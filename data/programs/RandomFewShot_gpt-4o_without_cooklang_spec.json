Heat a frying pan over a medium heat with a little oil, add all the vegetables and fry for 5 minutes, add the cooked noodles to the vegetables, stir in the soy sauce, oyster sauce and sweet and sour sauce. When the noodles are warm and the sauces have thickened and reduced slightly, place the noodles with the vegetables and on a plate. Cut a flat, rectangular slice of firm tofu cheese and fry in the same pan in which the noodles were fried, so that the cheese absorbs any remaining sauce and flavours.
