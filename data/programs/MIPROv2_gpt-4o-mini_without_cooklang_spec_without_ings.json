Put the pot on a high heat, skimming off any protein foam as it forms on top. Meanwhile peel the carrots (200g) and onions (200g). The carrots can be cut lengthwise and the onions in half. As soon as the broth starts to boil, add the carrots and onions. Add salt (2 tsp) to season and reduce the heat to a low simmer for 60-90 minutes. After the broth has simmered, strain it into another pan to remove the onions and chicken wings and allow to cool. Keep the carrots to finely chop and add to the broth. Shred some of the meat from the wings and add as well. Check for seasoning and enjoy.\\",

Slice the courgette and aubergine into slices a little less than a centimetre thick so that they cook evenly, cut red bell peppers into large chunks. Finely chop the fresh coriander and parsley, then deseed and finely chop the red chilli, red onion and garlic clove. Mix the herbs, chilli and garlic with the red onion and peppers in a bowl, add salt, sugar, vinegar and freshly ground black pepper, mix thoroughly so that the acid dissolves the sugar and salt, into this mixture add a little olive oil, enough to create the desired consistency. Brush the vegetables lightly with olive oil and using a grill pan, heat over a high heat and roast the courgettes, aubergines and bell peppers. Then line a baking tray with tinfoil, place the courgettes on the foil and roast for 12 minutes in the oven. Season the beef steak with salt and pepper on both sides, brush with cooking oil and grill in a frying pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side until seared and golden brown. After frying, place in the oven on the tray with the vegetables. Cook for 6-10 minutes, depending on how you want the steak done. The longer you cook the meat, the more well done the steak will be. When the meat is cooked to your liking, remove the steak and vegetables, place on a plate and drizzle over the chimichurri sauce and serve extra sauce on the side, garnishing with a sprinkling of extra chopped herbs.",
