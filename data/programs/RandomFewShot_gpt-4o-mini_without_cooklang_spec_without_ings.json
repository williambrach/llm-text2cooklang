Tearing rather than cutting prevents the leaves from bruising. Cut bell peppers into strips. Halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the sun-dried tomatoes into julienne strips. Heat a frying pan, preferably cast-iron as it conducts better heat. Add a little oil and fry the beef loin or fillet in one piece, along with the bell\/ red peppers in the same pan. Take a mixing bowl and toss together the torn salad leaves, rocket salad, cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes and pesto sauce. Place in a heaped pile on a plate, garnish with the roasted bell peppers, cut the beef into slices and arrange with the bell peppers. The longer you cook the beef, the less rare it will be.",
