After baking, take the fish out of the oven and place on a platter, garnish with either fresh or roasted cherry tomatoes, roasted whole garlic cloves (these can be done when baking the fish) and wedges of lemon. The fish also goes nicely with baby new potatoes and garlic butter.",

Cooklang is a specific notation system used to write recipes in a structured and standardized way. Here's how the program works: 1. **Input Processing**: The program takes a plain recipe text as input. This input is required as specified by the `recipe_text` field in the `StringSignature`. 2. **Instruction**: The program is given specific instructions to convert the provided recipe text into Cooklang formatting. It is instructed to return only the Cooklang formatted recipe and not any other information, ensuring the output is clean and adheres strictly to the Cooklang specifications. 3. **Processing & Conversion**: - A class `CookLangFormatterNoStepsNoIngredients` extends `dspy.Module`. - The class initializes with a `ChainOfThought` process named `CookLangSignatureNoStepsNoIngredients`, which suggests the use of a step-by-step logical reasoning method to carry out the transformation. - The `forward` method of this class takes the plain recipe text and processes it using this chain of thought to output the Cooklang formatted recipe. 4. **Output Specification**: The fields `rationale` and `cooklang` are marked as required outputs. `rationale` seems to annotate or explain the transformation process, while `cooklang` is the final output in Cooklang format. 5. **Calling the Chain of Thought**: When the `forward` method is invoked with `recipe_text`, the `ChainOfThought` process is called to generate the prediction (i.e., the Cooklang formatted recipe). In summary, the program automates the conversion of traditional recipe texts into a standardized Cooklang format using a structured approach involving specified instructions and a chain of reasoning. This process ensures that each step from input to output is logically and systematically handled.\n\nMODULE: self.prog = dspy.ChainOfThought(CookLangSignatureNoStepsNoIngredients)\n\nTASK DEMO(S):\n\nBASIC INSTRUCTION:\nConvert plain recipe text with provided ingredients into Cooklang text format.\nReturn only Cooklang formatted recipe, dont return any other information. Return whole recipe in Cooklang format! Dont stop till you reach the end of the recipe.\n\nTIP: Make sure your instruction is very informative and descriptive.\n\nPROPOSED INSTRUCTION:\n\n---\n\nConvert the provided plain text recipe into a structured and well-formatted Cooklang text. Carefully identify and annotate each ingredient, piece of equipment, and timing step according to the Cooklang syntax. Ensure that the entire recipe is processed without omitting any part. Return solely the Cooklang formatted recipe text and exclude any other information. Ensure that the output strictly follows the Cooklang notation standards and provides a comprehensive representation of the recipe.",
