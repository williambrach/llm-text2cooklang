        "recipe_text": " Rinse the jasmin rice (50g) and white quinoa (30g) under running water to get rid of the starch. Pour the water into a saucepan, add the rice and quinoa, season with salt (2g) and simmer on a medium heat. Rinse and pat dry the turkey breast fillets (125g) or chicken breast fillets (125g) gently with paper towel. Cut them into cubes. Defrost the frozen corn (40g) and frozen green beans (40g) and cut into slices. Often these are already prepared for you. Peel red onion (40g) and finely chop along with red bell peppers (40g). Heat a frying pan with a little oil (1 tbsp) and saut\u00e9 the onion and pepper for 5 minutes. Add the turkey or chicken fillets to the vegetables, stir-fry for about 5 minutes and add the green beans and corn, stir-fry for another 5 minutes. The quinoa rice should be cooked by this time, just check to make sure it is al dente. Remove side dish from the heat. Add the tinned tomatoes (40g) to the turkey, add sugar (5g) to balance acidity and salt (1\/2 tsp) to taste. Braise for 5 minutes. Place the quinoa rice on a plate and top with the turkey\/chicken and vegetables. Garnish with chopped parsley.",

        "ingredients": "1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill",
        "recipe_text": "Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.",
