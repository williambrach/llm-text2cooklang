Rinse the bream (450g) or your choice of fish (cod, seabass, or catfish), remove any scales that may remain, as well as fins. You can mostly have this done by your local fishmonger. Make a slit in the back, separate the flesh from the bones using a flat fish knife, cut out the centre bone. Remove the guts, rinse and pat dry with paper towel. Again, one can usually buy the fish already prepared for you. Rinse and pat dry courgette (50g), lemon (40g), red bell pepper (50g) and cherry tomatoes (30g). Peel the red onion (30g) and slice the onion into half rings, cut courgettes into thin rounds and the red pepper into medium slices, halve the cherry tomatoes. Drizzle the fish with freshly squeezed lemon juice and a sprinkle of olive oil, then season with salt and a grind of black pepper. Heat a frying pan over medium heat with a little oil just to prevent sticking and help with browning. Saut\u00e9 the chopped vegetables with the Provence herbs (1\/2 tsp) and salt and pepper. On a flat baking tray, place the fish on tin foil with the shiny side down so as not to reflect the heat, you can also use baking paper. Stuff the fish with the roasted vegetables and bake for 15 minutes. It is also nice to top the fish with fresh fennel for baking, if you should have any around. After baking, take the fish out of the oven and place on a platter, garnish with either fresh or roasted cherry tomatoes, roasted whole garlic cloves (these can be done when baking the fish) and wedges of lemon. The fish also goes nicely with baby new potatoes and garlic butter.",

Slice the courgette and aubergine into slices a little less than a centimetre thick so that they cook evenly, cut red bell peppers into large chunks. Finely chop the fresh coriander and parsley, then deseed and finely chop the red chilli, red onion and garlic clove. Mix the herbs, chilli and garlic with the red onion and peppers in a bowl, add salt, sugar, vinegar and freshly ground black pepper, mix thoroughly so that the acid dissolves the sugar and salt, into this mixture add a little olive oil, enough to create the desired consistency. Brush the vegetables lightly with olive oil and using a grill pan, heat over a high heat and roast the courgettes, aubergines and bell peppers. Then line a baking tray with tinfoil, place the courgettes on the foil and roast for 12 minutes in the oven. Season the beef steak with salt and pepper on both sides, brush with cooking oil and grill in a frying pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side until seared and golden brown. After frying, place in the oven on the tray with the vegetables. Cook for 6-10 minutes, depending on how you want the steak done. The longer you cook the meat, the more well done the steak will be. When the meat is cooked to your liking, remove the steak and vegetables, place on a plate and drizzle over the chimichurri sauce and serve extra sauce on the side, garnishing with a sprinkling of extra chopped herbs.",
