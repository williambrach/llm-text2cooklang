Mix the herbs, chilli and garlic with the red onion and peppers in a bowl, add salt, sugar, vinegar and freshly ground black pepper, mix thoroughly so that the acid dissolves the sugar and salt, into this mixture add a little olive oil, enough to create the desired consistency. Brush the vegetables lightly with olive oil and using a grill pan, heat over a high heat and roast the courgettes, aubergines and bell peppers. Then line a baking tray with tinfoil, place the courgettes on the foil and roast for 12 minutes in the oven. Season the beef steak with salt and pepper on both sides, brush with cooking oil and grill in a frying pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side until seared and golden brown. After frying, place in the oven on the tray with the vegetables. Cook for 6-10 minutes, depending on how you want the steak done. The longer you cook the meat, the more well done the steak will be. When the meat is cooked to your liking, remove the steak and vegetables, place on a plate and drizzle over the chimichurri sauce and serve extra sauce on the side, garnishing with a sprinkling of extra chopped herbs.",

    "extended_signature_instructions": "Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing the `CookLangFormatterNoSteps` module using the dspy library:\n\n**Step 1: Define the inputs and outputs**\n\nDefine the inputs (`recipe_text`, `ingredients`) and output (`cooklang`) for this program using the `Field` class from the dspy library.\n\n```python\nfrom dspy import Field\n\nrecipe_text = Field(annotation=str, required=True)\ningredients = Field(annotation=str, required=False)\ncooklang = Field(annotation=str, required=True)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Define the program signature**\n\nDefine the program signature as a ChainOfThought module that represents the pipeline processing steps. Note that `CookLangSignatureNoSteps` is not defined in this code snippet, you should create it according to your specific requirements.\n\n```python\nfrom dspy import ChainOfThought\n\nclass CookLangFormatterNoSteps(dspy.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.prog = dspy.ChainOfThought(CookLangSignatureNoSteps)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Call the program**\n\nCreate an instance of `CookLangFormatterNoSteps`, call it on some input recipe text and ingredients, and retrieve the predicted \"Cooklang\" formatted output from the result.\n\n```python\ncook_lang_formatter = CookLangFormatterNoSteps()\nrecipe_text = \"Cooking time: 30 minutes. Preheat oven at 180\u00b0C and bake for 20 minutes.\"\ningredients = \"Egg, Flour\"\nresult = cook_lang_formatter(recipe_text=recipe_text, ingredients=ingredients)\nprint(result.cooklang)\n```\n\nThis code will output the equivalent recipe text in \"Cooklang\" format.\n\nThe proposed instruction is already very informative and descriptive. To further improve it, you could make it even more specific about what constitutes a successful execution of this program (e.g., \"Return only the Cooklang formatted recipe without any extraneous information\").",
