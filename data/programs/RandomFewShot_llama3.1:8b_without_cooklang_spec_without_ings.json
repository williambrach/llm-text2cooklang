As soon as the broth starts to boil, add the carrots and onions. Add salt (2 tsp) to season and reduce the heat to a low simmer for 60-90 minutes. After the broth has simmered, strain it into another pan to remove the onions and chicken wings and allow to cool. Keep the carrots to finely chop and add to the broth. Shred some of the meat from the wings and add as well. Check for seasoning and enjoy.\\",
