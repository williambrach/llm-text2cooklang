https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

"It seems like you're trying to provide a recipe for Russian Salad, but I'll need to point out some errors in the instructions.

Here's a corrected version of the recipe:

**Recipe: Russian Salad**

**Ingredients:**

* 1 kg corned beef
* 3 medium potatoes
* 3 medium carrots
* 1 cup frozen peas
* 4 hardboiled eggs
* 6 pickles (dill or other variety)
* 1 cup mayonnaise
* Fresh dill for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. **Cook the corned beef**: Place the corned beef in a large pan and simmer for 2 hours.
2. **Prepare the potatoes and carrots**: Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes, then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for another 10-15 minutes until both are tender.
3. **Cool the vegetables**: Allow the potatoes and carrots to cool down to a point where they can be handled easily.
4. **Peel and dice the potatoes**: Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape off the thin layer of skin from the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes.
5. **Dice the carrots**: Add the diced carrots to the bowl with the potatoes.
6. **Cook the frozen peas**: Cook the frozen peas according to package directions. Set aside to cool down.
7. **Prepare the eggs**: Peel and dice the hardboiled eggs.
8. **Chop the pickles**: Chop 6 pickles finely. If using larger pickles, try using 3 instead.
9. **Assemble the salad**: Toss the carrots, peas, diced potatoes, chopped pickles, and diced eggs together in a bowl.
10. **Add the mayonnaise**: Mix everything together gently before adding the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if needed for binding.
11. **Chill the salad**: Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together.
12. **Garnish with fresh dill**: Garnish with finely chopped fresh dill (1 tbsp) before serving.

Note: I've corrected some minor errors in the original recipe, but overall, it seems like a basic guide for making Russian Salad."
