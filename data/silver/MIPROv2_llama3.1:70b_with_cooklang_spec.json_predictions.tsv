https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

"Based on the provided text, let's break down the steps and ingredients involved in each recipe to determine which one is more complex.

**Recipe 1 (Smoothie)**

* Ingredients: 7 items
* Steps:
	1. Combine all ingredients.
	2. Blend until smooth.
	3. Allow to settle for a few minutes.
	4. Pour into a bowl.
	5. Garnish with fresh blueberries and raspberries.

**Recipe 2 (Beef Cut with Vegetables and Chimichurri Sauce)**

* Ingredients: 17 items
* Steps:
	1. Preheat the oven.

Again, one can usually buy the fish already prepared for you. Rinse and pat dry courgette (50g), lemon (40g), red bell pepper (50g) and cherry tomatoes (30g). Peel the red onion (30g) and slice the onion into half rings, cut courgettes into thin rounds and the red pepper into medium slices, halve the cherry tomatoes. Drizzle the fish with freshly squeezed lemon juice and a sprinkle of olive oil, then season with salt and a grind of black pepper. Heat a frying pan over medium heat with a little oil just to prevent sticking and help with browning. Sauté the chopped vegetables with the Provence herbs (1/2 tsp) and salt and pepper. On a flat baking tray, place the fish on tin foil with the shiny side down so as not to reflect the heat, you can also use baking paper. Stuff the fish with the roasted vegetables and bake for 15 minutes. It is also nice to top the fish with fresh fennel for baking, if you should have any around. After baking, take the fish out of the oven and place on a platter, garnish with either fresh or roasted cherry tomatoes, roasted whole garlic cloves (these can be done when baking the fish) and wedges of lemon.

2. **Understand the cooking method**: The recipe starts by preheating the oven to 180 degrees, indicating that baking is involved.
3. **Prepare the parchment paper**: A rectangular piece of parchment or baking paper is cut, which will be used to wrap the salmon and courgettes.
4. **Prepare the courgette**: The courgette is washed, cut into 5 mm thick rounds, and placed on the parchment paper. Olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme are added for seasoning.
5. **Add the salmon steak**: The salmon steak is placed on top of the courgettes and seasoned with salt.
6. **Wrap in parchment paper**: The salmon and courgettes are wrapped in the parchment paper to prevent drying out.
7. **Bake in the oven**: The wrapped salmon and courgettes are baked in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
8. **Make the sauce**: While the fish is baking, a sauce is prepared by heating double cream, horseradish, and salt in a saucepan until thickened.
9. **Assemble and serve**: The baked salmon and courgettes are placed on a plate, topped with the sauce, and garnished with cherry tomatoes cut in half and a lemon wedge.

Overall, the recipe appears to be well-structured and easy to follow.

However, I do have some suggestions for improvement:

* Consider adding more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the steps involved.
* You may want to specify the type of salt used (e.g., kosher salt or sea salt).
* It might be helpful to provide guidance on how to shred the chicken meat and chop the carrots.
