https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

Slice the beef cut into 200 g pieces. Slice the courgette and aubergine into slices a little less than a centimetre thick so that they cook evenly, cut red bell peppers into large chunks. Finely chop the fresh coriander and parsley, then deseed and finely chop the red chilli, red onion and garlic clove. Mix the herbs, chilli and garlic with the red onion and peppers in a bowl, add salt, sugar, vinegar and freshly ground black pepper, mix thoroughly so that the acid dissolves the sugar and salt, into this mixture add a little olive oil, enough to create the desired consistency. Brush the vegetables lightly with olive oil and using a grill pan, heat over a high heat and roast the courgettes, aubergines and bell peppers. Then line a baking tray with tinfoil, place the courgettes on the foil and roast for 12 minutes in the oven. Season the beef steak with salt and pepper on both sides, brush with cooking oil and grill in a frying pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side until seared and golden brown. After frying, place in the oven on the tray with the vegetables. Cook for 6-10 minutes, depending on how you want the steak done. The longer you cook the meat, the more well done the steak will be.

Again, one can usually buy the fish already prepared for you. Rinse and pat dry courgette (50g), lemon (40g), red bell pepper (50g) and cherry tomatoes (30g). Peel the red onion (30g) and slice the onion into half rings, cut courgettes into thin rounds and the red pepper into medium slices, halve the cherry tomatoes. Drizzle the fish with freshly squeezed lemon juice and a sprinkle of olive oil, then season with salt and a grind of black pepper. Heat a frying pan over medium heat with a little oil just to prevent sticking and help with browning. Sauté the chopped vegetables with the Provence herbs (1/2 tsp) and salt and pepper. On a flat baking tray, place the fish on tin foil with the shiny side down so as not to reflect the heat, you can also use baking paper. Stuff the fish with the roasted vegetables and bake for 15 minutes. It is also nice to top the fish with fresh fennel for baking, if you should have any around. After baking, take the fish out of the oven and place on a platter, garnish with either fresh or roasted cherry tomatoes, roasted whole garlic cloves (these can be done when baking the fish) and wedges of lemon.
