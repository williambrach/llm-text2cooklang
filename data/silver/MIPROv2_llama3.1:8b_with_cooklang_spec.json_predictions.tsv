https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

"It seems like you're trying to analyze a recipe for a Russian salad. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**Step 0:** Cook corn beef (1 kg) - This is not actually a ""step"" but rather a preparation that needs to be done before starting the recipe.

**Step 1:** Cook potatoes and carrots - The first actual step in making the salad is to cook the potatoes and carrots. This involves steaming them until they are firm but tender, or boiling them if preferred.

**Step 2:** Prepare other ingredients - While the potatoes and carrots are cooking, prepare the frozen peas according to package directions and set them aside to cool.

**Step 3:** Cool and peel potatoes - Once the potatoes and carrots are done cooking, allow them to cool down. Then, peel the potatoes and dice them into small cubes.

**Step 4:** Dice other ingredients - Next, dice the cooked carrots, hardboiled eggs, and pickles into smaller pieces.

**Step 5:** Combine ingredients - Add the diced carrots, peas, eggs, and pickles to a medium serving bowl with the diced potatoes.

**Step 6:** Add meat (if using) and mix - If using corn beef, add it to the bowl and mix everything together gently.

**Step 7:** Add mayonnaise - Stir in one cup of mayonnaise to start with, and add more if needed to bind the ingredients together.

**Step 8:** Chill and garnish - Finally, cover the salad and chill it for at least an hour or overnight. Just before serving, garnish with finely chopped dill.

"It seems like there are two recipes provided, one for a potato soup and another for a chicken wrap. I'll provide a response based on the first recipe for the potato soup.

## Step 1: Peel and chop the potatoes
The first step is to peel and chop the potatoes into chunks. This will help break down the cell structure of the potatoes, making it easier to cook them later on.

## Step 2: Sauté the vegetables
Next, we need to sauté the chopped onions, mushrooms, and potatoes in a frying pan with a little oil until they are golden brown. This step is important as it will add flavor and texture to the soup.

## Step 3: Season the vegetables
After sautéing the vegetables, we need to season them with salt, pepper, and rosemary. This will enhance the flavor of the soup and make it more aromatic.

## Step 4: Cook the vegetables in water
Now that the vegetables are seasoned, we need to cook them in water until the potatoes are tender. This step is crucial as it will break down the starches in the potatoes and make the soup creamy.

## Step 5: Blend the soup
Once the potatoes are tender, we can remove the soup from the heat and blend it with a blender. This will help to puree the vegetables and create a smooth consistency for the soup.

## Step 6: Add cream and seasonings
After blending the soup, we need to add double cream and salt to taste. This will give the soup a rich and creamy texture, as well as enhance its flavor.

## Step 7: Garnish with black pepper
Finally, we can garnish the soup with freshly cracked black pepper. This will add a nice touch of flavor and aroma to the dish.

"It seems like you've provided two recipes for vegetable-based dishes, but they contain some inconsistencies and potential errors. Here's a breakdown of the issues I've identified:

**Recipe 1: Vegetable Soup**

* The quantities of potatoes (200%g), onions, and mushrooms seem excessive.
* The quantities of salt (4%g), pepper (1/4%tsp), and chopped fresh rosemary (1/4%tsp) are too high for a typical serving size.
* The cooking time for the potatoes might be too long.

**Recipe 2: Ratatouille-Style Dish**

* The cooking time for the carrots might be too short.
* Dicing the tomatoes seems unnecessary, as they're typically added directly to the dish without further dicing.

Overall, both recipes have some issues with ingredient quantities and cooking times. However, Recipe 1 has more significant problems with excessive seasoning amounts and the addition of double cream to a vegetable soup."

I'll analyze the reasoning behind this recipe step by step:

**Preparation of ingredients**: The first step involves removing excess fat or sinew from the beef loin and finely dicing it, along with peeling and finely dicing a red onion. This suggests that the chef wants to ensure the quality and texture of the ingredients are optimal for the dish.

**Mixing the ingredients**: The diced beef and onion are mixed together in a bowl, which implies that the flavors and textures of both ingredients need to be combined to create the tartare. This step likely helps to distribute the flavors evenly and creates a harmonious balance between the two ingredients.

**Seasoning**: Salt, pepper, and Worcester sauce are added to the mixture, indicating that these seasonings will enhance the flavor of the dish. The specific amounts (1/4 tsp salt, 1/5 tsp pepper) suggest a deliberate and nuanced approach to seasoning, which is likely intended to bring out the natural flavors of the beef.

**Toasting the bread**: The ciabatta is toasted in a pan without oil, which implies that the crispy texture and slightly charred flavor of the bread will complement the tartare. This step may also be intended to add a satisfying crunch to the dish.

**Assembly and serving**: Finally, the tartare is placed on a plate, served with the toasted ciabatta, and garnished with a wedge of lemon. The reasoning behind this final step likely involves creating a visually appealing presentation that showcases the different components of the dish. The combination of flavors, textures, and colors may be intended to create a harmonious and balanced culinary experience.

Overall, the reasoning behind this recipe seems to focus on creating a delicate balance of flavors and textures in the Beef Tartare. The careful preparation and combination of ingredients, along with the deliberate seasoning and presentation, all contribute to a dish that is likely intended to be both visually appealing and deliciously flavorful."

"It seems like you have provided a recipe for a Buckwheat Soba Noodle dish. I'll help you break down the reasoning step by step to ensure that the instructions are clear and logical.

**Step 1: Cook the noodles**
The first step is to cook the buckwheat soba noodles according to the packet instructions. This ensures that the noodles are cooked properly and ready for the next steps.

**Step 2: Prepare the vegetables**
While the noodles are cooking, wash and peel the red onions, bell pepper, garlic, and mushrooms. Slice the vegetables into strips or rings. This step prepares the ingredients needed for the dish.

**Step 3: Fry the vegetables**
Heat a frying pan over medium heat with oil and fry the vegetables for 5 minutes. This step cooks the vegetables and adds flavor to them.

**Step 4: Combine noodles and sauces**
Add the cooked noodles to the pan with the fried vegetables. Stir in soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sweet and sour sauce. This step combines the cooked noodles with the flavorful vegetables and sauces.

**Step 5: Thicken the sauces**
When the sauces have thickened and reduced slightly, place the noodle mixture on a plate. This step ensures that the sauces are properly incorporated into the dish.

**Step 6: Fry the tofu cheese**
Cut a flat slice of firm tofu cheese and fry it in the same pan used for the noodles and vegetables. This step adds an extra layer of flavor and texture to the dish.

**Step 7: Assemble the dish**
Place the fried tofu cheese on top of the noodle mixture and garnish with toasted sesame seeds and torn coriander leaves. This final step completes the Buckwheat Soba Noodle dish, making it visually appealing and flavorful.

The reasoning behind each step is to ensure that the ingredients are properly prepared, cooked, and combined to result in a delicious and well-presented Buckwheat Soba Noodle dish."

"It seems like you've provided two recipe summaries, one for Potato Soup and another for Chicken Recipe. I'll provide a response in the format you requested:

**Recipe Summary**

The recipes provided are simple and easy-to-follow instructions for making potato soup and chicken dish with a creamy sauce.

**Key Steps**

1. **Potato Soup**: Peel and chop potatoes, onions, and mushrooms; sauté them in oil until golden; add water and simmer until potatoes are tender; blend the mixture with double cream and season to taste.
2. **Chicken Recipe**: Wash and pat dry chicken fillets; rub with pepper and salt; fry bacon until crispy and add string beans to braise slowly; fry chicken fillets separately and combine with beans and braised together; make a sauce by chopping dill florets, pickled onion, garlic, and stirring in salt to taste, then adding sour cream.

**Reasoning Behind the Recipes**

The recipes are designed to be comforting and flavorful. The sautéing of vegetables brings out their flavors, while the simmering process cooks the potatoes through. The addition of double cream gives the soup a creamy texture, and the seasoning with salt and pepper enhances the overall flavor. In the chicken recipe, the use of bacon adds a smoky flavor to the beans, while the chicken is cooked through and seasoned with pepper and salt. The addition of sour cream gives the sauce a rich and creamy texture.

**Overall Assessment**

Both recipes are straightforward and easy to follow, making them great options for home cooks looking to make comforting and flavorful dishes."

However, I'll need some clarification on what you're trying to achieve. It looks like there are two separate recipes provided, one for a potato soup and another for a salad. To assist you, could you please specify which recipe you'd like me to help with? If it's the potato soup, I can try to provide a step-by-step reasoning process using the Cooklang syntax.

Let's take the potato soup recipe as an example. Here's how we can break down the steps:

1. Peel and chop the potatoes, onions, and mushrooms into chunks.
2. Heat a frying pan over medium heat with oil and sauté the vegetables until golden.
3. Season the vegetables with salt, pepper, and rosemary.
4. Put the sautéed vegetables into a saucepan and pour water over them until just covered.
5. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and leave at a low simmer until the potatoes are tender.
6. Remove the soup from the heat and blend with a blender.
7. Add double cream and salt to taste.
8. Garnish with freshly cracked black pepper.

Here's how we can represent these steps in Cooklang format:

Cooklang: Peel and chop the @potatoes{100%g}, @onions{50%g} and @mushrooms{200%g} into chunks. The potatoes will need to be cut a bit smaller. Heat a #frying pan{} over a medium heat with a little @oil and sauté the vegetables until golden. Season with @salt{4%g}, @pepper{1/4%tsp} and chopped fresh @rosemary{1/4%tsp}.

"I can't provide a Cooklang recipe for a dish without knowing its ingredients. However, I can guide you on how to create one.

To create a Cooklang recipe, we need to identify the missing ingredient in the soup recipe and add it to the list of ingredients. Let's assume the missing ingredient is potatoes. Here's an updated version:

Ingredients: potatoes, 4%tsp salt, chopped fresh rosemary (1/4%tsp), double cream (50g), black pepper

Recipe Text: Sauté the vegetables in a pan until they're tender. Add the sautéed vegetables to a saucepan and pour water over them until just covered. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, then lower the heat and leave at a low simmer until the potatoes are tender. Remove the soup from the heat and blend with a blender, add the double cream and salt to taste. Garnish with freshly cracked black pepper.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the Cooklang. We identified the missing ingredient as potatoes and added it to the list of ingredients. The recipe text remains the same, but now we have all the necessary information to create a complete Cooklang recipe.

Cooklang:
Ingredients: potatoes, 4%tsp salt, chopped fresh rosemary (1/4%tsp), double cream (50g), black pepper

I'll provide reasoning for both recipes:

**Potato Soup Recipe**

1. The recipe starts with cutting the potatoes into chunks, which is a common step in many soups.
2. Heating oil in a frying pan over medium heat to sauté the vegetables until golden is also a standard technique.
3. Adding salt, pepper, and chopped fresh rosemary to season the vegetables is a typical practice.
4. Pouring water over the sautéed vegetables and bringing it to a boil before simmering until the potatoes are tender is a common method for cooking vegetables in liquid.
5. Blending the soup with a blender and adding double cream and salt to taste is a standard way to finish a creamy soup.

**Avocado and King Prawn Salad Recipe**

1. Cutting the avocado in half, removing the stone, and peeling off the skin are necessary steps to prepare the fruit for use.
2. Heating oil in a frying pan over medium heat to sauté the king prawns with salt, thyme, rosemary, and garlic is a common technique for cooking seafood.
3. Adding lemon juice to prevent browning of the avocado is a standard practice when working with avocados.
4. Arranging the avocado slices on a plate, topping them with rocket salad leaves, placing the sautéed prawns on top, and drizzling with lime juice and olive oil are all typical steps for assembling a composed salad.

In both recipes, the reasoning is based on common cooking techniques and practices that are widely used in various cuisines."

	* Potatoes
	* Onions
	* Mushrooms
	* Oil
	* Salt
	* Pepper
	* Rosemary
	* Double cream
2. **Quantify ingredients**: You provided specific quantities for each ingredient, including weights and measurements.
3. **Understand the cooking process**: You described the steps to prepare the soup, from peeling and chopping the vegetables to blending and seasoning the final product.
4. **Generate recipe text**: Finally, you wrote out the recipe in a clear and concise format, using the ingredients and quantities you'd previously identified.

The resulting recipe text is:

""Peel and chop the 100g potatoes, 50g onions, and 200g mushrooms into chunks. The potatoes will need to be cut a bit smaller. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat with a little oil and sauté the vegetables until golden. Season with 4g salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and chopped fresh rosemary. Put the sauted vegetables into a saucepan and pour water over them until just covered. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, then lower the heat and leave at a low simmer until the potatoes are tender. Remove the soup from the heat and blend with a blender and add 50g double cream and some salt to taste.""

Well done!"

I'll help you identify the differences between them.

**Recipe 1 (Vegetable Soup)**

* Peel and chop potatoes, onions, and mushrooms into chunks.
* Sauté the vegetables until golden with a little oil.
* Add water to cover the vegetables and simmer until tender.
* Blend the soup with a blender, add double cream and salt to taste.
* Garnish with freshly cracked black pepper.

**Recipe 2 (Fish Soup)**

* Pour water into a saucepan and boil on medium heat.
* Peel and cut potatoes and carrots into large pieces.
* Add the vegetables to the pan and boil until soft.
* Cut salmon and hake fillets into large pieces and add to the pan, along with soy sauce, fish sauce, cherry tomatoes, green peppers, and double cream.
* Bring the soup gently to a boil without overcooking the fish.

The main differences between these two recipes are:

1. **Ingredients**: Recipe 1 is for vegetable soup, while Recipe 2 is for a fish-based soup.
2. **Cooking method**: Recipe 1 involves sautéing the vegetables before simmering them in water, whereas Recipe 2 boils the potatoes and carrots first, then adds the fish and other ingredients to the pan.
3. **Flavor profile**: Recipe 1 has a more straightforward flavor profile with just salt, pepper, and double cream, while Recipe 2 incorporates soy sauce, fish sauce, cherry tomatoes, and green peppers for added depth of flavor.

"It looks like you've provided two recipes with varying levels of complexity and potential issues that require reasoning skills to resolve. Here's a breakdown of your analysis:

**Recipe 1:**

* The recipe has a clear structure, with each step building on the previous one.
* There are no major issues or areas where reasoning is required, except for estimating cooking time based on potato size and desired tenderness.

**Recipe 2:**

* The recipe appears more complex, with several potential issues that require reasoning skills:
	+ Estimating cooking times for eggs, soba noodles, carrots, and chicken fillets.
	+ Clarifying the type of casserole being referred to (if any).
	+ Adjusting cooking time for chicken fillets based on thickness and size.
	+ Determining the amount of soy sauce to add.

Overall, both recipes require some basic reasoning skills, such as estimating cooking times and following instructions. However, Recipe 2 seems to have more potential issues that require critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.

## Step 1: Identify the main ingredients and their quantities in each recipe.
Recipe 1 has potatoes, onions, mushrooms, salt, pepper, rosemary, and double cream. Recipe 2 has carrots, courgette, bell peppers, vegetable oil, green beans, cherry tomatoes, garlic, and basil leaves.


## Step 2: Determine the cooking method for each recipe.
Both recipes involve sautéing vegetables in a pan before simmering them in water or stock to create a soup. However, Recipe 1 also involves blending the soup with a blender and adding double cream.


## Step 3: Consider the flavor profiles of each recipe.
Recipe 1 has a strong herb presence with rosemary and pepper, while Recipe 2 seems to focus on a mix of vegetables with garlic and basil for added flavor.


## Step 4: Think about the potential dietary restrictions or preferences that these recipes cater to.
Both recipes appear to be vegetarian-friendly. However, Recipe 1's use of double cream might make it less suitable for those with dairy allergies or intolerances.

The final answer is: There isn't a specific numerical answer to this problem, as it involves analyzing and understanding the provided recipes rather than solving a mathematical equation."

I'll help you analyze the reasoning behind each recipe step-by-step.

**Recipe 1: Potato Wedge Soup**

1. **Peel and chop vegetables**: The first step is to peel and chop the potatoes, onions, and mushrooms into chunks. This is a basic preparation step that's essential for any soup or stew.
2. **Sauté the vegetables**: Next, heat a frying pan over medium heat with some oil and sauté the chopped vegetables until golden brown. This step adds flavor and texture to the dish.
3. **Season with herbs and spices**: After sautéing, season the vegetables with salt, pepper, and rosemary. This adds depth of flavor to the soup.
4. **Simmer the vegetables**: Then, put the sautéed vegetables into a saucepan, cover them with water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender. This step cooks the vegetables thoroughly.
5. **Blend and add cream**: Once the potatoes are tender, remove the soup from the heat and blend it with a blender. Add double cream and salt to taste. This finalizes the soup's texture and flavor.

**Recipe 2: Tomato Salad**

1. **Prepare the ingredients**: Wash the tomatoes, slice them into chunks (or halve cherry tomatoes), peel the red onions, and slice them into thin rings. Chop the coriander coarsely.
2. **Mix the ingredients**: Combine the sliced tomatoes, onion, and chopped coriander in a bowl.
3. **Season with salt and Worcester sauce**: Add salt, pepper (not explicitly mentioned but implied), a splash of olive oil, and Worcester sauce to the mixture. This step adds flavor to the salad.

In both recipes, the reasoning is straightforward:

* For the potato wedge soup, the steps are designed to cook the vegetables thoroughly, add flavor with herbs and spices, and then blend the mixture into a creamy soup.
* For the tomato salad, the steps focus on preparing the ingredients, mixing them together, and adding seasonings to create a simple side dish.
