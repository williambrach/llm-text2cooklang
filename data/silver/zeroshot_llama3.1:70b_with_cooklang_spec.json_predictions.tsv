https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

Start blender on low speed and increase to high. Blend until smooth, about 10 seconds. Add herbs (if using) and pulse to combine. (Alternatively, you can combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk vigorously until smooth.) To Cook: Heat a 10-inch nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron or carbon steel skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Lightly grease with oil or butter, using a paper towel to wipe out the excess. Hold the pan's handle in one hand and pour in 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60ml) batter, swirling and tilting pan immediately to spread batter in a thin, even layer over bottom of pan. Let cook until top looks dry, about 20 seconds. Using a thin metal or nylon spatula, lift one edge of crepe. Grab that edge with the fingers of both hands and flip crepe. Cook on second side for 10 seconds, then transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining batter. Fill crepes as desired (such as with butter, sugar, and lemon juice; with butter and jam; with ham, cheese, and eggs ; or with spinach and feta ) and serve.

data/bronze/recipes/jnobles_RecipeBook/Cook Files/Asiago Bagels.source	Asiago Bagels		1 tsp yeast,500 g bread flour,625 mL water,0.5 tsp yeast,375 g bread four,2.5 tsp salt,2 tsp malt powder,95 g bread flour,225 g Asiago cheese,1 tbsp baking soda,some  cornmeal,100 g Asiago cheese	"1. To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop. 2. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining ¾ cup flour to stiffen the dough. 3. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). Add the Asiago cheese during the last minute or so of kneading, and knead until evenly distributed. The dough should be firm, stiffer than French bread dough, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour - all the ingredients should be hydrated. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77 to 81 degrees F. If the dough seems dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems sticky or tacky, add more flour to achiever the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky. 4. Immediately divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Form the pieces into rolls. 5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes. 6. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with shaping the bagels: Push a hole through the center of the roll with your thumb and stretch out the hole to 2½ inches in diameter, making sure that the resulting ring has a fairly even thickness all the way around. 7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pan. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. 8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the ""float test"". Fill a small bowl with cool or room temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough. 9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby. 10. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil another minute. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. Sprinkle the bagels with the shredded Asiago as soon as they come out of the water. 11. When all the bagels have been boiled and topped, place the pans on the two middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 8 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are only baking one pan at a time, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until the bagels turn golden brown. 12. Remove the pans from the oven and let the bagels cool on a rack for 15 minutes or longer before serving"	"To make the sponge, stir the @yeast{1%tsp} into the @bread flour{500%g} in a #4-quart mixing bowl{}.

Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour – when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball.Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough.Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.For the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks.Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper.Leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. When the time’s up, taste, and season to perfection.To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls.Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about 15 minutes – this will make them easier to roll it thinly.Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about ½cm thick.Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top.

Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge.When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/gas 9.At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges.

Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent, stirring occasionally. This step is crucial as it forms the base flavor of the goulash. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Then, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the sweet Hungarian paprika. This helps prevent the paprika from burning, which could cause a bitter taste. Add the diced beef shank or shin to the pot, stirring well to coat the meat with the paprika and onion mixture. Return the pot to the heat and cook the meat until it starts to brown slightly. Add the sliced carrots, bell peppers, dried marjoram, and caraway seeds to the pot. Stir everything together to combine the flavors. Pour in the beef stock, ensuring that the meat and vegetables are fully submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer gently for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender. If you choose to use tomatoes, add them about halfway through the cooking time. Taste the goulash and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper as needed. Serve the goulash hot, traditionally with a side of fresh bread or small dumplings (csipetke).

Chop or puree tomatoes. Peel and cube potatoes to¾ inch pieces. Keep them immersed in a bowl of water until used. Pour 2 tablespoons oil to a hot pan. When the oil becomes hot, add the optional ingredients - mustard, cumin seeds & curry leaves. Add chopped onions & saute until they turn pink or transparent. Stir in ginger garlic and saute for 1 to 2 mins, until a nice aroma comes out. Next add the tomatoes, turmeric and salt. Saute until the tomatoes break down & turn soft and mushy. Add red chili powder, garam masala, coriander powder & cumin powder (optional). Saute everything well for 2 to 3 minutes until the masala begins to smell good. Drain the potatoes and add them to the pan. Saute them for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour water or light coconut milk to partially cover the potatoes. Bring it to a boil on a medium heat. Cook covered until the potatoes are fully done or fork tender. Stir the curry in between to prevent burning. Taste test and add more salt if needed along with kasuri methi (optional). If the potato curry is runny, open the lid and evaporate the excess liquid. If there is not enough liquid pour some hot water and bring it to consistency. Turn off and keep the pot covered for 2 mins for the flavors to be absorbed.Garnish potato curry with coriander leaves. Serve with rice or roti. To make this potato curry in Instant pot, dice the potatoes to 1 inch pieces so they don’t turn mushy when cooked under pressure. Press saute button on your Instant pot and pour oil to the steel insert. When the oil turns hot, add mustard, cumin seeds, curry leaves and onions. Saute well until the onions turn light golden & lose their raw flavor. Then stir in ginger garlic and saute for 1 minute. Add tomatoes and salt. Stir fry until tomatoes break down and turn completely mushy. Then add all the spice powders – garam masala, chili powder, turmeric,  coriander powder (optional), cumin powder (optional). Sauté for 30 to 60 seconds until aromatic. Press cancel. Add the potatoes and pour 1 cup water. Deglaze the pot with a spatula to release any bits of food stuck there. Optionally you can also cook your rice in your instant pot by placing your rice bowl over the trivet. Use hot water to cook your rice as the cook time for this recipe is only 4 mins. Secure the Instant pot with the lid. Press pressure cook button and set the timer to 4 minutes. When the Instant pot is done cooking, do a quick pressure release by moving the steam vent from sealing to venting. Potato curry is ready at this stage.

data/bronze/recipes/brendanmckenzie_recipes/european/french/croissants.source	croissants		60 grams butter,500 grams flour,50 grams sugar,2 tsp salt,1 tsp yeast,360 ml milk,345 grams butter,2 tbsp flour	Watch the video below and use the step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe before beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets. Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and begin to knead the dough. Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rest. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rest. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test. Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video below, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14×10-inch rectangle. The dough isn’t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step. In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video below. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn. If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn.I usually don’t have to. Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2ndand 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) At the end of the next step, you’ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared! Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8×20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer—I suggest keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Whisk the egg wash ingredients together.Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash. Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375°F (190°C). Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool. Croissants taste best the same day they’re baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking	"Cut the @butter{60%grams} in four 1tbsp pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment.

Add the @flour{500%grams}, @sugar{50%grams}, @salt{2%tsp}, and @yeast{1%tsp}. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute.

With the mixer running, slowly pour in the @milk{360%ml}. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes. The dough will be soft. It will (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball.

Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined. Gently flatten the dough out, and cover with plastic wrap. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. Roll it into a 14×10-inch rectangle. The dough isn't extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement.

Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet. Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.

In a large bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the @butter{345%grams} and @flour{2%tbsp} together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement - it should be half the width of the flattened dough. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. The butter layer should be firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step.

Roll the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn't an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers.

On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. It's best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.

If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn.

2nd turn: Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.

3rd turn: Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.

Long rest: Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.

Shape the croissants: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8×20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. 

Preheat oven to 204°C.

Egg wash: Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash.

Bake the croissants: Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 190°C.

Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool."	"```cooklang
title: Homemade Croissants

ingredients:
  - 1 cup warm milk
  - 1/4 cup granulated sugar
  - 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
  - 3 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (for laminating)
  - 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

instructions:
  - In a small bowl, combine warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.
  - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and melted butter. Add the yeast mixture and mix until a shaggy dough forms.
  - Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
  - Rest the dough in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.
  - Roll out the dough into a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.
  - Spread the softened butter evenly over the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on both sides.
  - Fold the dough like a letter, then rotate and roll it out again into a large rectangle. Repeat this process (known as laminating) two more times.
  - After the final lamination, rest the dough in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
  - Roll out the dough into an 8x20-inch rectangle. Cut it in half vertically, then cut each half into 4 equal pieces horizontally, and finally cut each piece diagonally to form triangles.
  - Roll each triangle into a croissant shape, curling the ends towards each other. Place the shaped croissants on parchment-lined baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch of space between them.
  - Let the croissants rest at room temperature for 1 hour, then refrigerate them for another hour or up to 12 hours.
  - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Brush the tops of the croissants with an egg wash and bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown.

Let this sit while you make the stir fry. In a mortar and pestle, pound the Thai chilies into a fine paste. Add the garlic and the chopped mild chilies and pound into just a rough paste. Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat, adding about 1 tablespoon of the oil if your beef is lean. Once the wok is very hot, add the beef and spread it out. Sear the beef without moving it until the underside is browned. Toss the beef, and notice how the beef will start to release quite a bit of liquid  - keep stirring until all of this liquid has evaporated, and the beef starts to sizzle in its own fat. Once the beef is sizzling, allow it to cook without stirring for 15-20 seconds to brown the beef further and develop flavour, then toss, and repeat the browning 1-2 more times. Turn the heat down to medium, push the beef to one side of the pan, and if there isn’t much fat in the pan, add a little bit more oil just so there’s enough to saute the garlic. Add the garlic and chili paste and sauté in the oil for 30 seconds until aromatic and the garlic starts to turn golden, and then toss it with the beef. Turn the heat up to high and add about half of the stock or water, fish sauce, sugar, and black pepper; toss to mix well.  Add the julienned mild chilies and toss for 30 seconds; if it’s looking too dry, add more of the stock or water. Turn off the heat, add the basil and mix just until wilted. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more sugar or fish sauce as needed, and add a little more water or stock if it feels too dry. Set this aside while you fry the eggs. To fry the eggs Thai-style, I recommend frying them 1 at a time to prevent them from sticking to each other. There are 2 options for frying eggs:For crispy whites and semi-set yolk: Add about ¼ inch of frying oil to a small nonstick frying pan and put it over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the egg and allow the egg white to bubble. Use a spoon to occasionally baste the top of the egg with oil to cook the yolk. Once the whites are crispy and browned around the edges and the yolk is set to your liking, you can remove it from the pan.For eggs with crispy whites and runny yolk: Separate the egg white and the egg yolk. Add about ¼ inch of frying oil to a small nonstick frying pan and put it over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the egg white and let it fry until the edges start to turn brown.  Use your spatula to push the middle of the white down to make an indent for the yolk to sit in. Once the egg white is browned around the edges, carefully place the yolk into the indentation, and use a spoon to baste some oil around the edges of the egg yolk to help it stick to the egg white. Remove from the pan and allow to drain. To serve, put jasmine rice on a plate, spoon the pad kra pao over half of the rice, and top everything with the fried egg. You can then drizzle the prik nam pla on top of the egg when ready to eat	"**Prik Nam Pla**: Add chopped @Thai chilies{2} and @garlic{1%clove} into a small bowl, then add the @fish sauce{2%tbsp} and @lime juice{2%tsp}.

Line a 9-inch square baking pan (I love this one and this one) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan. Set aside. Whisk the flour, 1 cup (85g) oats, brown sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and vanilla, and stir until the mixture resembles moist crumbly sand and no dry spots remain. You will have a little more than 3 cups of crust mixture, or about 520g. Press 2/3 of the mixture (about 2 cups/345g—doesn’t have to be exact) into the prepared baking pan. Press it into the pan (with your hands, a large spoon or spatula, or the bottom of a measuring cup) to form a crust. Bake for 10 minutes, and then remove from the oven to slightly cool. Place the cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside, within reach of the stove. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, combine the cherries, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cherries begin to release their juices—about 4 to 6 minutes. While the cherries continue to cook, carefully remove a couple of spoonfuls of the juice from the saucepan and add to the bowl of cornstarch. Using a fork, mix the cornstarch and cherry juice together until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir this mixture into the filling, then bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the filling has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the almond extract. Pour/spread the filling over the warm crust. Stir 2 Tablespoons oats into the remaining crumble mixture, then sprinkle it all over the filling, and lightly press it down with the back of a large spoon or flat spatula. Bake for about 40–50 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few jammy cherry specks!). Mine take about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. After about 1 hour, you can place the whole pan in the refrigerator to help speed things up. Whisk the icing ingredients together. Add more milk to thin out, if desired. Drizzle over cooled bars. Lift the bars out of the pan using the edges of the parchment paper lining and place the whole thing on a cutting board. Slice squares with a sharp knife and, for neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover cherry pie bars (with or without icing) at room temperature for up to 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week	"Tip: You can use dark sweet cherries (fresh or frozen) instead of sour cherries. Reduce the sugar in the filling to 1/3 cup (67 g) and add another 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Still, if I had to choose, I would use sour cherries here.

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line a #9-inch square baking pan{} with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan. Set aside.

Add the @melted unsalted butter{142%g} and @vanilla{1%tsp}, and stir until the mixture resembles moist crumbly sand and no dry spots remain.

You will have a little more than 3 cups of crust mixture, or about 520 g. Press 2/3 of the mixture (about 2 cups/345 g) into the prepared baking pan. Press it into the pan (with your hands, a large spoon or spatula, or the bottom of a measuring cup) to form a crust. Bake for ~{10%minutes}, and then remove from the oven to slightly cool.

Make the filling: Place the @cornstarch{11%g} in a #small bowl{} and set aside, within reach of the stove. In a #medium saucepan{} set over medium heat, combine the @sour cherries{525%g}, @granulated sugar{100%g}, and @lemon juice{1%tsp}.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cherries begin to release their juices, about 4 to ~{6%minutes}. While the cherries continue to cook, carefully remove a couple of spoonfuls of the juice from the saucepan and add to the bowl of cornstarch. Using a #fork{}, mix the cornstarch and cherry juice together until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir this mixture into the filling, then bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the filling has thickened, about ~{10%minutes}.

Remove from heat and stir in the @almond extract{1/4%tsp}.

Pour/spread the filling over the warm crust. Stir 2 Tablespoons @whole rolled oats{2%Tbsp} into the remaining crumble mixture, then sprinkle it all over the filling, and lightly press it down with the back of a large spoon or flat spatula.

Bake for about 40 to ~{50%minutes} or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few jammy cherry specks!). Mine take about 45 minutes.

Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan set on a #wire rack{}. After about ~{1%hour}, you can place the whole pan in the refrigerator to help speed things up.

Make the optional icing: Whisk the icing ingredients together. Add @whole milk{2%Tbsp} to @confectioners' sugar{120%g} and @almond extract{1/4%tsp} to thin it out, if desired. Drizzle over cooled bars.

Lift the bars out of the pan using the edges of the parchment paper lining and place the whole thing on a cutting board. Slice squares with a sharp knife and, for neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut.

Using your fingertips, rub the vanilla into the sugar until it’s fragrant. Add the butter, confectioners’ sugar and salt to the bowl and, using the paddle attachment, beat on low speed until the mixture is smooth and creamy (you don’t want it to get light and fluffy), scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Drop in the egg yolk and beat for 1 minute. Add the flour all at once. Mix on low speed just until the flour has disappeared (or do this last little bit by hand with a flexible spatula). Turn the dough out onto a work surface and divide it in half. (You can use a scale to get two equal halves if you wish.) Shape each half into a log about 9 inches long. Wrap the logs in parchment or plastic film and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. When you’re ready to bake: Preheat the oven to 325ºF. (See notes above re baking—if your oven runs hot, you may want to reduce the temperature. I preheat my oven to 300ºF, which registers 325º on an oven thermometer.) Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Add a splash of cold water to the yolk (or the reserved egg white) and mix with a fork to blend. Brush each log with this egg wash and roll it in the sanding (or granulated) sugar until it’s evenly coated. Using a sturdy knife, trim the ends of the logs if they’re ragged, then cut the dough into ½-inch-thick rounds.

Preheat oven to 325°F/163°C. Line a large 17 x 12 inch (43 x 30 cm) baking or cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. To peel the almonds: Over high heat, bring a saucepan of water to a boil.Add the almonds and boil for 1 minute (no longer because they will soften). Drain and rinse with cold water to cool and stop them from cooking. Spread onto a towel and rub them until the peels come off. Dry well. Add the almonds to a food processor or blender and pulse until finely chopped. In a mixing bowl, stir together the almonds, flour and orange peel. To a small saucepan add the sugar, heavy cream corn syrup and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture comes to a rolling boil and the sugar is completely dissolved. Continue to simmer for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the mixture to the almond mix along with the vanilla. Stir until combined. Allow to cool until it is cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Using a teaspoon measuring spoon, portion out 1 teaspoon of dough and roll into a ball using your hands. Roll the balls as round as you can, this will ensure nice round cookies. If the dough seems dry and crumbly, simply put a ball of the dough your warm hand it will soften so you can shape. Place the dough balls 6-inches (15 cm) apart  on to the prepared baking sheet. They spread to 3-inches (7 ½ cm) in diameter. You'll need to work in batches to fit your baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. If they join together, use a sharp knife to separate while they are hot and soft on the baking sheet as they will harden very quickly. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes until they are no longer soft, then transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining dough. In a microwave safe bowl, add the chocolate and microwave in 10 second increments, stirring in between until melted. Be careful not to burn. Take a cooled cookie, spread the chocolate on one side, take another cookie and make a sandwich, press carefully as they are delicate. Repeat with all cookies. If you would like to drizzle chocolate on the top, put the melted chocolate into a small ziptop bag. Snip of a very tiny piece of the corner and this will allow you to get the perfect drizzle.

Without chilling, the piped cookies will over-spread. If you chill the dough prior to shaping, the dough will be too cold/stiff to pipe. Line 2–3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2–2.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above. Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1–2-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it’s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1–2-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar. Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Bake the chilled cookies for 12–15 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes. Keep your eye on them. They’re done when the edges lightly brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Tips from our Bakers: Flavor to taste: classic pizzelle are often flavored with anise extract or anise seed. Butter-rum, lemon, or rum flavors are also delicious.

Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until creamy and soft, about 5 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape frosting into a small bowl, or as many bowls as you would like colors, and cover with plastic pressed directly against the surface. Set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature. For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Using the same bowl and paddle attachment used for frosting (no need to clean), combine butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy, pale ivory, and soft, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk egg whites, cream, and vanilla in a glass measuring cup until homogeneous. With the mixer still running, add liquid mixture in 4 or 5 additions, pausing to scrape bowl and beater about halfway through.

Line the bottom and sides of a 9×13-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a large bowl. Add the cubed butter and using a pastry cutter, two forks, or a food processor, cut in the butter until all the flour is coated and resembles pea-sized crumbles. (See photo above for a visual.) This takes at least 5 minutes of cutting in with a pastry cutter. Whisk the egg, milk, and vanilla together in a small bowl. Pour over the flour/butter mixture and gently mix together until the mixture resembles moist crumbly sand. See photo above for a visual. You will have about 6 cups of the crust/crumble mixture. Set 2 cups aside. Pour the remaining into the prepared pan and flatten down with your hands or a flat spatula to form an even crust. It will be a little crumbly—that’s ok. Set aside. (Almonds will be used in the topping in the next step.) Mix all of the cranberry filling ingredients together. Spread over the crust. Sprinkle the remaining crumble mixture all over the cranberries. Sprinkle the almonds all over top. Bake for about 40-50 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few jammy cranberry specks!). Mine take about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack.

Set aside. In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick. Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days. Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it—see me do this in the video below. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.) Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating. Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing, easy cookie icing, or cookie decorating buttercream. Feel free to tint any of the icings with gel food coloring.

Brown the Butter - Cut the butter into 14 even-sized pieces. In a medium skillet, melt 10 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until golden brown and a nutty aroma forms, 1 to 3 minutes.Remove the skillet from heat. Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter into warm butter until completely melted. Mix the Butter and Sugars– In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the browned butter to the mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla. Whisk on medium speed (setting 5) until combined, 30 seconds. Whisk and Rest– Add the whole egg and yolk to the mixing bowl. Whisk on medium-high speed (setting 8) until smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes.Repeat the whisking and resting process 3 more times: 30 seconds mixing at medium-high speed and 3 minutes of rest. After four total times, the mixture should be thick, smooth, and shiny. Add the Flour and M&M's - Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in ¾ cup M&M candies and chocolate chips. Give the dough a final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain. Chill the Dough - Transfer the mixing bowl to the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer for 15 minutes. Chill until the dough firms up, around 65 to 70ºF (18 to 21ºC). The dough should not feel overly sticky. Preheat the Oven - Adjust the oven rack to the middle position. Heat to 375°F (191ºC). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, then set aside. Roll Out Dough Balls– Divide the dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (about 60 grams, 2 ounces), and roll into a ball. If the dough starts to warm and get sticky, place it on a sheet tray and refrigerate for 15 minutes.For a rustic appearance, tear the dough balls in half, then press the two halves together again with the lumpy torn sides facing upward to expose the chips. Shape the sides of the dough back into a circle. If desired, use the remaining ¼ cup of M&M candies and press some on top, so they pop out of the surface.Arrange dough balls at least 2"" apart on lined baking sheets, 8 portions per tray. Smaller baking sheets can be used but will require baking in 3 batches. The dough should be room temperature or just below for even cooking, around 65 to 70ºF (18 to 21ºC). Bake the Cookies - Bake one tray at a time in the center position for 5 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet. Continue to bake until the edges are golden brown and the centers look slightly underdone, about 5 to 7 minutes. The color will continue to darken during cooling. Let Them Cool - Leave the cookies on the baking sheet to cool for 3 to 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack.

-- Prepare the Dry Ingredients
In a medium bowl, whisk together @all-purpose flour and @baking soda, and set aside.
-- Brown the Butter
Cut @unsalted butter into 14 even-sized pieces. In a medium skillet, melt 10 tablespoons of @unsalted butter over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until golden brown and a nutty aroma forms, ~{1 to 3%minutes}.
Remove the skillet from heat. Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons of @unsalted butter into warm @unsalted butter until completely melted.
-- Mix the Butter and Sugars
In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the browned @unsalted butter to the mixing bowl. Add @granulated sugar, @dark brown sugar, @salt, and @vanilla. Whisk on medium speed (setting 5) until combined, ~{30%seconds}.
-- Whisk and Rest
Add @egg and @egg yolk to the mixing bowl. Whisk on medium-high speed (setting 8) until smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, ~{30%seconds}. Let the mixture stand for ~{3%minutes}.
Repeat the whisking and resting process 3 more times: ~{30%seconds} mixing at medium-high speed and ~{3%minutes} of rest. After four total times, the mixture should be thick, smooth, and shiny.
-- Add the Flour and M&M's
Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the @all-purpose flour mixture until just combined, ~{1%minute}. Stir in ¾ cup @M&M candies and @semisweet chocolate chips. Give the dough a final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain.
-- Chill the Dough
Transfer the mixing bowl to the refrigerator for ~{30%minutes} or the freezer for ~{15%minutes}. Chill until the dough firms up, around 65 to 70ºF (18 to 21ºC). The dough should not feel overly sticky.
-- Preheat the Oven
Adjust the oven rack to the middle position. Heat to 375°F (191ºC). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, then set aside.
-- Roll Out Dough Balls
Divide the dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (about 60 grams, 2 ounces), and roll into a ball. If the dough starts to warm and get sticky, place it on a sheet tray and refrigerate for ~{15%minutes}.
For a rustic appearance, tear the dough balls in half, then press the two halves together again with the lumpy torn sides facing upward to expose the chips. Shape the sides of the dough back into a circle. If desired, use the remaining ¼ cup of @M&M candies and press some on top, so they pop out of the surface.
Arrange dough balls at least 2"" apart on lined baking sheets, 8 portions per tray. Smaller baking sheets can be used but will require baking in 3 batches. The dough should be room temperature or just below for even cooking, around 65 to 70ºF (18 to 21ºC).

FOR THE COOKIES:  Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Pulse peanuts in food processor until finely chopped, about 8 pulses. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, milk, and egg together in second bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture with rubber spatula until combined. Stir in peanuts until evenly distributed. Using . scoop or tablespoon measure, place 12 mounds, evenly spaced, on each prepared baking sheet. Using damp hand, flatten mounds until 2 inches in diameter. Bake until deep golden brown and firm to touch, 15 to 18 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Repeat portioning and baking remaining dough.

Assembled cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days. Since we knew that the starch granules in flour mute the flavor of peanut butter we briefly turned our attention to an Internet sensation flourless peanut butter cookies made with just peanut butter sugar egg and sometimes a bit of baking soda. Indeed when we tried a sample batch of our cookies sans flour they tasted super peanut-y and baked up looking much like traditional peanut butter cookies. Why didnt these flourless cookies melt right off of the cookie sheet Because peanut butter contains approximately  percent carbohydrates and  percent protein components that absorb moisture and harden into a stable network in the heat of the oven. But without the sturdier structure that only starch from wheat flour can provide these cookies fell apart in our hands before we could even take a bite.  Many recipes for peanut butter sandwich cookies disappoint with soft dull-tasting cookies and overly sweet fillings. Heres how we improved the concept	"Do not use unsalted peanut butter for this recipe.

Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup, if desired. To prepare your carrots, peel them and then cut them on the diagonal so each piece is about ½″ thick at the widest part (see photos). Place the carrots on the baking sheet. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Toss until the carrots are lightly coated in oil and seasonings. Arrange them in a single layer. Roast the carrots until they’re caramelized on the edges and easily pierced through by a fork, 25 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway. (Heirloom carrot varieties will roast in as little as 25 minutes, but regular carrots are more dense and typically require 35 to 40 minutes.) Once the carrots are almost done roasting, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, coriander and cumin (if following a variation, see recipe notes for additions). Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.Pour in the vegetable broth and water, while scraping up any browned bits on the bottom with a wooden spoon or sturdy silicone spatula. Add the roasted carrots to the pot when they are out of the oven. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 15 minutes, to give the flavors time to meld. Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, working in batches if necessary. (Do not fill past the maximum fill line or the soup could overflow!) Add the butter, lemon juice (or lime, if following the Thai variation), and several twists of black pepper. Blend until completely smooth. Add additional salt and pepper if necessary, to taste.
