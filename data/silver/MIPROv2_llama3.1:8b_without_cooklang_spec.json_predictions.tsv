"It seems like you're trying to use a programming-like syntax (Cooklang) to represent a recipe. However, the provided text doesn't follow any specific structure or rules that would make it a valid Cooklang program.

To reason about this, let's try to identify the components of the given text:

1. **Caramel formation**: The first part describes making caramel by heating sugar and water, then adding gelatine.
2. **Mixing with gelatine**: The text mentions mixing the cooled-down gelatine with the caramel mixture.
3. **Eggwhite addition**: It talks about beating eggwhites until they form a foam, then adding them to the gelatine-caramel mixture.

If we were to rewrite this in a more structured Cooklang syntax, it might look something like this:

```
# Caramelize sugar and water
@heat 200°C for 5 minutes

# Add gelatine and mix until dissolved
@gelatine 10g @mix until dissolved

# Cool down the mixture
@cool_down for 15 minutes

# Beat eggwhites until foamy
@eggwhites 2 @beat until foamy

# Mix eggwhites with gelatine-caramel mixture
@gelatine_caramel_mixture @add @eggwhites

# Pour into a pudding bowl and refrigerate
@pudding_bowl @refrigerate for 2 hours
```

Please note that this is an interpretation of the original text, and the actual Cooklang syntax might be different.

To answer your question about reasoning step by step:

* Identify the ingredients and their quantities.
* Understand the cooking process and the sequence of steps involved.
* Recognize the custom syntax (Cooklang) used to represent the recipe.
* Attempt to rewrite the recipe in a more structured Cooklang syntax, following the identified components.

https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

"It seems like you're trying to analyze a recipe for a Russian salad. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**Step 0:** Cook corn beef (1 kg) - This is not actually a ""step"" but rather a preparation that needs to be done before starting the recipe.

**Step 1:** Cook potatoes and carrots - The first actual step in making the salad is to cook the potatoes and carrots. This involves steaming them until they are firm but tender, or boiling them if preferred.

**Step 2:** Prepare other ingredients - While the potatoes and carrots are cooking, prepare the frozen peas according to package directions and set them aside to cool.

**Step 3:** Cool and peel potatoes - Once the potatoes and carrots are done cooking, allow them to cool down. Then, peel the potatoes and dice them into small cubes.

**Step 4:** Dice other ingredients - Next, dice the cooked carrots, hardboiled eggs, and pickles into smaller pieces.

**Step 5:** Combine ingredients - Add the diced carrots, peas, eggs, and pickles to a medium serving bowl with the diced potatoes.

**Step 6:** Add meat (if using) and mix - If using corn beef, add it to the bowl and mix everything together gently.

**Step 7:** Add mayonnaise - Stir in one cup of mayonnaise to start with, and add more if needed to bind the ingredients together.

**Step 8:** Chill and garnish - Finally, cover the salad and chill it for at least an hour or overnight. Just before serving, garnish with finely chopped dill.

"It seems like you're trying to provide a recipe in a specific format, but it's not quite clear what the task is. However, I'll try to break down the steps and provide a response based on the given text.


## Step 1: Identify the ingredients
The first step would be to identify the ingredients needed for the recipe. In this case, the ingredients are listed at the end of the text.

## Step 2: Understand the cooking process
Next, we need to understand the cooking process involved in making the dish. The text describes a series of steps, including preheating the oven, dicing vegetables, beating eggs, and baking an omelette.

## Step 3: Follow the instructions
To complete the task, we would follow the instructions provided in the text, which include preheating the oven to 180 degrees, finely dicing red bell pepper, courgette, tomatoes, and grating mozzarella cheese. We would then beat eggs in a bowl and add double cream, salt, and pepper, whisking well with a fork.

## Step 4: Combine ingredients
After preparing the ingredients, we would combine them by adding the diced vegetables to the egg mixture and pouring it into a pan. We would sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top and place the pan in the oven to bake for 7 minutes.

## Step 5: Serve the dish
Once the omelette is baked, we would remove it from the oven using an oven mitt, fold it in half, and place it on a plate. Finally, we would garnish with finely chopped fresh parsley and serve with a relish or chutney.


The final answer is: There is no numerical answer to this problem, as it involves following a recipe to prepare a dish."

**Recipe 1: Soba Noodle Soup**

The recipe involves boiling eggs, soba noodles, carrots, and chicken fillets. The ingredients are then combined in a casserole pot with chicken stock, and the mixture is boiled for about 5 minutes. Finally, the broth is poured into a soup bowl, and the egg is sliced and added to the soup along with soy sauce and green pepper garnish.

Reasoning:

1. Boiling eggs and soba noodles separately ensures they are cooked properly.
2. Adding carrots to the broth provides extra flavor and nutrients.
3. Using chicken fillets in strips allows for even cooking and easier consumption.
4. Combining all ingredients in a casserole pot simplifies the cooking process.
5. Pouring the broth into a soup bowl and adding garnishes like green pepper and soy sauce enhances the presentation and flavor of the dish.

**Recipe 2: Strawberry Smoothie**

The recipe involves blending strawberries, banana, blueberries, milk, oat flakes, chia seeds, granola, and salt in a blender. The mixture is then allowed to settle for 10 minutes before being poured into a bowl and garnished with fresh blueberries and raspberries.

Reasoning:

1. Blending the ingredients together ensures they are well combined and easy to consume.
2. Allowing the mixture to settle for 10 minutes allows the flavors to meld together and the chia seeds to absorb excess liquid.
3. Using frozen fruit (if desired) can help maintain a thicker consistency in the smoothie.
4. Garnishing with fresh blueberries and raspberries adds a pop of color and freshness to the dish.

In both recipes, the reasoning behind the instructions is focused on ensuring proper cooking or blending techniques, combining ingredients for optimal flavor and texture, and presenting the final dish in an appealing way.

However, I noticed that you provided a new set of ingredients: seeds, 10g granola, 1g salt, 10g fresh blueberries, and 10g fresh raspberries. It seems like this is a separate recipe or a continuation of one of the previous recipes. If you could provide more context or information about what this recipe is for, I'd be happy to help you analyze it!"

"It seems like you have two different texts: one about cooking a meal and the other about making a bread recipe. I'll assume you want me to analyze the first text, which is about cooking a meal.

To answer your question, here are some steps to follow:

1. **Identify the ingredients**: The text doesn't explicitly mention the ingredients used in the meal.
2. **Understand the cooking process**: The text describes a series of steps to cook the meal:
	* Add the egg yolk and stir quickly on low heat.
	* Remove from heat to prevent the egg yolk from curdling or scrambling.
3. **Analyze the cooking techniques**: The text uses various cooking techniques, such as stirring and heating.
4. **Consider the presentation**: Not applicable in this case.

However, I noticed that you provided a bread recipe text at the end. If you'd like me to analyze it instead, please let me know!

As for your original question, ""has warmed up in the sauce and the sauce has thickened,"" it seems like a step in the cooking process where the sauce is being heated and thickened. The addition of the egg yolk at this stage is likely to enrich the sauce and prevent it from becoming too thin.

"It seems like there are two separate recipes here, but I'll address them together since they're both part of a single text.

To evaluate this recipe, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Roasting vegetables**: The recipe starts with roasting courgettes, aubergines, and bell peppers in a grill pan over high heat, then finishing them in the oven for 12 minutes. This seems like a reasonable way to prepare these vegetables.
2. **Cooking beef steak**: The recipe involves grilling the beef steak for 2 minutes per side, then finishing it in the oven with the roasted vegetables. This is a common method for cooking steak to desired doneness.
3. **Making chimichurri sauce**: The recipe mentions making chimichurri sauce by mixing herbs, chilli, garlic, red onion, salt, sugar, vinegar, and olive oil. However, it doesn't provide clear instructions on how to make the sauce or what quantities of each ingredient to use.

Some potential issues with this recipe are:

* **Lack of clarity**: The recipe jumps abruptly from cooking the steak to making the chimichurri sauce without providing any guidance on how to prepare the sauce.
* **Ingredient quantities**: The recipe doesn't specify the quantities of ingredients needed for 4-6 people, which could lead to confusion or waste if too much is prepared.
* **Cooking time**: While the cooking times mentioned seem reasonable, it's unclear whether they're sufficient for a larger group.

To improve this recipe, I'd suggest adding clear instructions on how to make the chimichurri sauce and specifying ingredient quantities. Additionally, providing more detailed guidance on cooking times and temperatures would be helpful."

One is for a fish dish, and the other appears to be a misinterpretation or incomplete recipe for a soup. Let's focus on the first recipe for the fish dish.

To evaluate this recipe, we can consider the following points:

1. **Ingredient list**: The ingredients are listed in a clear and concise manner.
2. **Instructions**: The steps to prepare the dish are provided, but they seem to be incomplete or missing some crucial details.
3. **Cooking method**: The recipe involves baking the fish with roasted vegetables, which is a reasonable approach.

However, there are some issues with this recipe:

* The instructions for preparing the fish (removing scales, fins, and guts) might not be necessary if you're buying pre-prepared fish from a market.
* The steps to prepare the vegetables (sautéing them in a pan) seem incomplete or missing some details.
* There's no clear indication of how long to bake the fish or what temperature to use.

To improve this recipe, we could add more detailed instructions for preparing the fish and vegetables, specify the cooking time and temperature, and provide additional suggestions for serving the dish (e.g., with baby new potatoes and garlic butter).

As for the second ""recipe"" provided, it seems to be a jumbled collection of ingredients and steps that don't form a coherent recipe. If you'd like, I can try to help you decipher what this might be intended to be or provide suggestions on how to create a new recipe from scratch!

Here's an updated version of the fish recipe with more detailed instructions:

**Fish Recipe**

Ingredients:

* 4 fish fillets (any white fish works well)
* 1/2 tsp Provence herbs
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Chopped vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, onions, carrots) for roasting
* Fresh fennel (optional)

Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. Season the fish fillets with salt, pepper, and Provence herbs.
3. Heat a little oil in a pan over medium heat and sauté the chopped vegetables until they're tender.
4. Place the fish on a flat baking tray lined with tin foil or parchment paper, shiny side down.
5. Stuff each fish fillet with the roasted vegetables and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until cooked through.
6. Garnish with fresh fennel (if using) and serve hot.

Note: You can adjust the cooking time based on the thickness of the fish fillets and your personal preference for doneness."

"It seems like you've provided two recipes, one for a chicken casserole and another for a pasta dish with tiger prawns. I'll help you break down the reasoning for each recipe step-by-step.


## Step 1: Prepare the ingredients
For the chicken casserole, we need to boil the carrots and soba noodles until they're soft. We also need to cut the green pepper into small rings and peel the boiled egg.

## Step 2: Cook the chicken
Cut the chicken fillets into strips and boil them in the stock for about 5 minutes.

## Step 3: Assemble the casserole
Add the chopped boiled carrots, boiled soba noodles, and cooked chicken to the pot. Pour the broth into a soup bowl and add sliced egg, soy sauce, and green pepper rings.

## Step 4: Prepare the ingredients for the pasta dish
Defrost the prawns in cold water and peel them if necessary. Wash the courgette and cut it into small round slices. Halve the cherry tomatoes and coarsely chop the garlic.

## Step 5: Cook the pasta
Add the wholemeal pasta to boiling water with salt, cook according to the package instructions, and then rinse in a colander.

## Step 6: Fry the vegetables and prawns
Heat oil in a deep frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add butter, fry the prawns with courgettes, thyme, rosemary, and salt until done.

## Step 7: Combine the pasta, vegetables, and prawns
Toss the cooked pasta with olive oil, add it to the vegetables and prawns, and top with cherry tomato halves and garlic. Check for seasoning.

## Step 8: Serve the pasta dish
Fry everything quickly, place in a bowl, garnish with Parmesan cheese sprinkled liberally on top, and add some fresh thyme.

I'll do my best to help you identify the issues and provide suggestions for improvement.

**Recipe 1: Casserole**

The instructions mention a #casserole, but it's not clear what this refers to. It could be a specific dish, a type of cooking vessel, or even a mistake in formatting. To clarify, I would suggest adding more context or information about the casserole, such as:

* What is the casserole made of?
* Is it a pre-made dish or something that needs to be prepared?

Additionally, the instructions mention @chicken stock, but it's unclear what this refers to. It could be a specific type of chicken broth or stock, or even a mistake in formatting. To clarify, I would suggest adding more context or information about the chicken stock, such as:

* What is the recipe for the chicken stock?
* Is it a store-bought product or something that needs to be prepared?

The other unclear references are @chicken fillets{50%g}, ~{5%minutes}, and @soy sauce{}. These could also be formatting mistakes or unclear references. To clarify, I would suggest adding more context or information about these ingredients and instructions.

**Recipe 2: Stir-Fry**

This recipe seems complete and clear. However, it's worth noting that the quantities for some of the ingredients (e.g., salt) seem quite small compared to the other ingredients. It might be worth reviewing the quantities to ensure they are accurate and make sense in the context of the recipe.

Overall, I would suggest revising Recipe 1 to provide more clarity and context about the unclear references. If you're unsure about any aspect of the recipes, feel free to ask for further clarification or guidance!"

You've successfully identified each preparation step, from removing excess fat to assembling the final dish.

To further enhance your analysis, here are some additional observations:

* The recipe assumes a certain level of culinary expertise, as it doesn't provide detailed instructions for tasks like peeling onions or mixing ingredients.
* The use of specific ingredient weights (e.g., 120g beef loin) and precise measurements (e.g., 0.250 tsp salt) suggests that the recipe is intended for experienced cooks who are familiar with these conventions.
* The inclusion of a ""Reasoning"" section at the end, where you walked through each step in detail, demonstrates a clear understanding of the recipe's structure and requirements.

Overall, your analysis effectively breaks down the recipe into manageable steps, making it easier for readers to follow along. Well done!"

One thing that stands out is that Recipe 1 seems to be missing a crucial step - cooking the chicken fillets before adding them to the stock. In Recipe 2, the chicken fillets are cooked separately in a pan for 2 minutes on each side, but in Recipe 1, they're simply boiled in the stock for 5 minutes.

Also, I'm curious about the ingredient quantities and proportions in both recipes. Are there specific amounts of chicken stock, soy sauce, sour cream, or other ingredients that are assumed to be used? If not, it might be helpful to add those details to make the recipes more clear and reproducible.

Lastly, have you considered any potential food safety issues with these recipes? For example, in Recipe 1, the boiled egg is added directly to the soup without being cooked further. In Recipe 2, the bacon is fried until crispy, but it's not specified whether it's been stored safely or if there are concerns about cross-contamination.

1. **Prepare vegetables**: Wash tomatoes, cucumber, red bell pepper and cut them into large chunks.
2. **Prepare lettuce**: Tear up the lettuce and mix it together in a bowl with the other ingredients (tomatoes, cucumber, red bell pepper).
3. **Add pesto and olives**: Add the pesto and olives to the bowl and toss lightly.

"It looks like there might be some confusion! The text provided doesn't seem to be a complete recipe for making pesto sauce, and it also mentions ""Recipe Text"" which is not a standard part of a recipe. Additionally, the first part of the text appears to be incomplete or unrelated to cooking chicken stock.

However, if we focus on the second part of the text, here's a breakdown of the steps and reasoning:

1. **Grate Parmesan cheese**: This step involves using a fine grater to grate 20g of Parmesan cheese.
2. **Roast pine nuts**: Roasting 10g of pine nuts in a dry pan until they become shiny and fragrant is a common technique to enhance their flavor and aroma.
3. **Prepare herb mixture**: Combining 1g of garlic, 50g of parsley, 85g of basil leaves, 2g of salt, and 0.250 tsp (which is approximately 1.25g) of pepper in the blender bowl will help bring out the flavors of the herbs.
4. **Blend herb mixture**: Blending the ingredients together in the blender to create a paste is essential to break down the herbs and mix them evenly.
5. **Dilute pesto sauce**: Diluting the blended mixture with 140g of olive oil (and possibly lemon juice, although it's not specified) will help achieve the desired consistency.

The reasoning behind these steps is to create a well-balanced and flavorful pesto sauce that can be used as a sauce for pasta, salads, or bread."

* Establish a consistent way of representing ingredients (e.g., using `@` symbols or a specific keyword).
* Define a standard format for cooking vessels (e.g., using `#` symbols or a specific keyword).
* Develop guidelines for representing cooking methods, temperatures, and times.

2. **Boil the eggs (1)**: Boiling eggs in a chicken soup recipe seems unusual, but let's assume it's for some reason not specified here.

6. **Pour chicken stock (0.4%l) into the pot and bring to the boil**: This step is clear!
7. **Cut the chicken fillets (50%g) into strips and boil in the stock for about 5 minutes**: We'll need to cook the chicken in the stock.
8. **Add the chopped boiled carrots and boiled soba noodles to the stock**: This makes sense!
9. **Pour the broth into a soup bowl**: Time to serve the soup!
10. **Peel the boiled egg and slice it in half, placing it into the soup**: Another unusual step, but let's assume it's for some reason not specified here.
11. **Add soy sauce to taste and garnish with green peppers**: This is a clear final step!

**Salad Recipe**

1. **Make the pesto first from the Pesto sauce recipe (not provided here)**: We'll need to make the pesto sauce before making the salad.
2. **Rinse and dry lettuce leaves (if they are not washed), tear them into pieces suitable for the salad**: This step is clear!
3. **Cut bell peppers into strips**: Time to prep the veggies!
4. **Halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the sun-dried tomatoes into julienne strips**: More veggie prep!
5. **Heat a frying pan, preferably cast-iron, add a little oil, and fry the beef loin or fillet in one piece, along with the bell/red peppers in the same pan**: We'll need to cook the beef and bell peppers.
6. **Take the cooked beef and bell peppers out of the pan and set them aside**: This step is implied, but let's make it clear!
7. **Add the cooked soba noodles (from the chicken soup recipe?) to the salad**: Wait, what? I think you meant to say ""add some other ingredient"" or ""serve the salad with a side"".
8. **Assemble the salad by combining all the ingredients**: Time to put everything together!

Before we begin, I just want to confirm that Cooklang is a markup language used for recipe formatting, and it seems like the provided recipes are written in this format. If I'm correct, each step in the recipe is denoted by a number (e.g., 1., 2., etc.), and ingredients are represented using a specific syntax (e.g., @ingredient{quantity}).

Now that we have that clarified, let's start analyzing Recipe 1:

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. `Put a #sauté pot{} on the stove.` - This step initializes the cooking process by placing a sauté pan on the stovetop.
2. `Boil the @eggs{1}.` - The recipe instructs to boil 1 egg, but it's unclear what this means in the context of the dish (e.g., is the egg being used as an ingredient or for some other purpose?).
3. `Boil the @soba noodles{40%g} (following package instructions).` - This step involves boiling soba noodles according to the package instructions, but it's unclear what percentage of 1 gram this represents.
4. `Cut the carrots into chunks and boil until soft.` - The recipe instructs to cut carrots into chunks and boil them until they're soft, but there's no specific quantity or cooking time mentioned.
5. `Cut the @green pepper{5%g} into small rings.` - This step involves cutting a green pepper into small rings, with an unclear quantity (5% of what?).
6. `Put the #casserole on the stove, pour @chicken stock{0.4%l} into the pot, and bring to a boil.` - The recipe places a casserole dish on the stovetop, pours in chicken stock, and brings it to a boil.
7. `Add the chopped boiled carrots and boiled soba noodles to the stock.` - This step involves adding cooked carrots and soba noodles to the chicken stock.
8. `Cut the @chicken fillets{50%g} into strips and boil in the stock for about ~{5%minutes}.` - The recipe instructs to cut chicken fillets into strips, boil them in the stock for an unclear duration (5% of what?), and then...
9. `Pour the broth into a soup bowl.` - This step involves pouring the cooked broth into a soup bowl.
10. ...and so on.

"It seems like you've provided two different recipes, one for a carbonara dish and another for a chicken noodle soup. I'll address both recipes separately.

**Recipe 1: Carbonara**

This recipe involves multiple steps:

1. **Separate the egg**: Separate the yolk from the white using only the yolk.
2. **Fry bacon**: Fry @bacon{60%g} over medium heat.
3. **Add cream and cheese**: Add half of @double cream{50%g} and half of @Parmesan cheese{20%g} to the fried bacon.
4. **Warm pasta**: Warm up @pasta{80%g} in the sauce until it's heated through and the sauce has thickened.
5. **Add egg yolk**: Add the egg yolk and stir quickly on low heat.

This recipe is relatively simple, but it requires attention to detail to prevent the egg yolk from curdling or scrambling.

**Recipe 2: Chicken Noodle Soup**

This recipe involves multiple steps:

1. **Boil eggs**: Boil the eggs.
2. **Boil soba noodles**: Follow the instructions on the back of the package to boil the soba noodles.
3. **Prepare carrots for broth**: Cut the carrots into chunks and boil until soft.
4. **Cut green pepper**: Cut the green pepper into small rings.
5. **Cook chicken fillets**: Cut the chicken fillets into strips and boil in the stock for about 5 minutes.
6. **Add ingredients to stock**: Add chopped boiled carrots, boiled soba noodles, and cooked chicken fillets to the stock.
7. **Prepare soup bowl**: Pour the broth into a soup bowl.
8. **Finish the dish**: Peel the boiled egg, slice it in half, place it in the soup, add soy sauce to taste, and garnish with green peppers.

This recipe is also relatively simple, but it requires attention to detail to ensure that each ingredient is cooked properly and added at the right time.

**Cooklang**

The Cooklang format you provided seems to be a structured way of presenting recipes. It includes:

* A list of ingredients
* A brief description of the dish (Recipe Text)
* A step-by-step guide to preparing the dish

This format can be helpful for cooks who want to follow a recipe and ensure that they don't miss any steps or ingredients. However, it's worth noting that some recipes may not fit perfectly into this format, especially if they involve complex techniques or multiple components."

The text you provided appears to be two separate recipes. The first recipe seems to be about making a chicken soup or casserole, while the second one is about cooking a vegetable-based dish.

Let me focus on the first recipe since it mentions chicken fillets and soy sauce. Here's my reasoning:

1. The recipe starts with cooking eggs and soba noodles, which is a common practice in many Asian dishes.
2. It then asks to boil carrots until soft, which suggests that they will be used as an ingredient in the final dish.
3. Green peppers are cut into small rings, which implies that they will be used as a garnish or added to the dish for flavor and texture.
4. The casserole (which is likely a pot or pan) is put on the stove with chicken stock, suggesting that this will be the base of the soup.
5. Chicken fillets are cut into strips and boiled in the stock for about 5 minutes, which indicates that they will be cooked through and added to the soup.
6. The chopped carrots and soba noodles are then added to the stock, along with the chicken fillets.
7. The broth is poured into a soup bowl, and an egg is peeled and sliced in half before being placed in the soup.
8. Finally, soy sauce is added to taste, and green peppers are used as a garnish.

As for the second recipe, it seems to be unrelated to the first one, but it provides a different set of ingredients and instructions for cooking a vegetable-based dish.
