https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

In medium bowl combine flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  Add sugar, egg and vanilla extract to the large bowl.  Stir dry ingredients into the wet.  Cover and chill dough for as little as an hour or up to 3 days. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Roll 1 tablespoon of dough into balls (a . cookie scoop is great for this), and roll them in the remaining white sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake cookies, one sheet at a time, for 10-12 minutes, until cookies are puffed, centers are set and they are beginning to form cracks.  Do not overbake.  Leave on sheets until they are cool enough to transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. If you want a slightly more substantial cookie, use a . cookie scoop, 2 tablespoons dough, for each cookie.  You will need to add a minute or two to the bake time and the batch will make about 18 cookies instead of 30	"-- Source: https://www.bakersbrigade.com/recipe/chewy-mexican-hot-chocolate-cookies/

In a #large bowl{}, bloom the @cocoa powder{60g} by mixing the warm @butter{170g}, stirring until the cocoa is completey dissolved and the texture is smooth. 

Add molasses{2%Tbsp} to the large bowl with the bloomed cocoa, mixing the molasses until it too dissolves. Set the bowl aside to cool (so that it doesn't cook the other ingredients prematurely)

In a #medium bowl{}, combine @all purpose flour{192g}, @baking soda{1%1/2%tsp}, @salt{1/2%tsp}, @cinnamon{1%tsp}, and @cayenne pepper{1/8 - 1/4%tsp}

Once cooled, add @sugar{200g} (you will need to set aside another half cup of @sugar to roll doughballs in{100g}), @egg{1%large}, and @vanilla paste{1%tsp} to the large bowl.

Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.

Cover and chill the dough in the #refrigerator{} for at least 1 hour, and up to 3 days.

When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl or deep plate, place the additional 100g of sugar.

Using a #No. 50 cookie scoop{}, scoop dough into balls of approximately 1 tablespoon, and roll them in the sugar. A No. 50 should yield you about 30 cookies.

Place dough balls 2 inches apart on ungreased #baking sheets{} or #silicone baking mats (optional){}.

Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for ~dough balls{10-12%minutes} until cookies are puffed, centers are set, and they are beginning to form cracks. 

Leave the cookies on the sheets until they're cool enough to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

* If you'd like a more substantial cookie, try using a #No. 30 cookie scoop (optional){}, which yields approx. 2 tablespoons of dough for each cookie. Add a minute or two to the bake time. This batch should make about 18 cookies (instead of the 30 cookies yielded by a No. 50)."	No Cooklang format found.

Put the cut-up butter in the freezer for a few minutes, while you work on the dry ingredients.  Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a standing mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix for a few seconds, just to combine, then turn off.   Add the butter pieces to the dry ingredients. Mix on the lowest setting possible for 5 to 10 seconds—pulsing on/off if necessary, so the flour doesn’t fly out of the bowl—then turn off. Err on the side of undermixing at this step. You want each butter piece to be coated in flour and slightly bashed by the paddle, but most of the pieces should be barely smaller than when you started.  Turn on the mixer to the lowest setting possible, slowly pour in the 1/4 cup very cold water. Once it’s all in, let the mixer run for a couple more seconds, then turn off and check in with the dough. The end goal is a very shaggy dough that holds together when squeezed, with some dough starting to grab onto the paddle attachment, and a few flour streaks on the side of the bowl. If the dough is still quite powdery and dry in some places and the sides of the bowl are still flour-coated, continue to mix while adding another tablespoon of water, and letting that incorporate for a couple seconds. (Repeat with more water—but only a very small amount!—if needed.)  Use your hands to gather the dough into a mass and dump onto a piece of plastic wrap. Use the plastic wrap to form the dough into a ball, then smush into a disc with your hands, so the plastic wrap is extremely snug.

Bash and add the unpeeled @ginger{2%thumb-sized piece} and @garlic{2%clove}, then toss with a good drizzle of @sesame oil. Put the @pork skin on a #baking tray and place both tray and casserole pan in the oven for around 40 minutes, or until the skin is perfectly crackled, then remove for garnish. This is also the perfect time to transfer the casserole pan to the hob, adding in the @pork belly{750%g} and @miso{1}. Cover with 3 litres of water, bring to the boil, then simmer gently on a low heat for around 3 hours, or until the pork belly is beautifully tender, skimming the surface occasionally. Lift the pork belly onto a tray and put aside, then sieve the broth and pour back into the pan. Return to the heat and reduce the liquid down to around 2.5 litres. While doing this, put a large #colander over the pan and steam the @spinach{400%g} until it’s wilted. Let it cool, then squeeze out the excess moisture and divide into 8. In a separate #pan, cook the @noodles{500%g} according to packet instructions, then drain and divide between 8 large warm bowls with the @beansprouts{8%small} and spinach. Slice and divide up the pork, then halve the eggs and place around the bowls. Trim the @spring onions{8}, finely slice with the chilli, and sprinkle between the bowls. Taste the broth and season with soy sauce, then ladle the steaming broth over everything. Tear over the @seaweed{2%envelope} and divide up the @kimchee{8%tbsp}.

To make the sponge, stir the yeast into the flour in a 4-quart mixing bowl. Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop. 2. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining ¾ cup flour to stiffen the dough. 3. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). Add the Asiago cheese during the last minute or so of kneading, and knead until evenly distributed. The dough should be firm, stiffer than French bread dough, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour - all the ingredients should be hydrated. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77 to 81 degrees F. If the dough seems dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems sticky or tacky, add more flour to achiever the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky. 4. Immediately divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Form the pieces into rolls. 5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes. 6. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with shaping the bagels: Push a hole through the center of the roll with your thumb and stretch out the hole to 2½ inches in diameter, making sure that the resulting ring has a fairly even thickness all the way around. 7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pan. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. 8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the ""float test"". Fill a small bowl with cool or room temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough. 9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby. 10. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil another minute. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. Sprinkle the bagels with the shredded Asiago as soon as they come out of the water. 11. When all the bagels have been boiled and topped, place the pans on the two middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 8 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are only baking one pan at a time, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.) After the rotation, lower the oven temperature to 450 degrees F and continue baking for about 8 minutes, or until the bagels turn golden brown. 12.

Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour – when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball.Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough.Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.For the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks.Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper.Leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. When the time’s up, taste, and season to perfection.To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls.Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about 15 minutes – this will make them easier to roll it thinly.Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about ½cm thick.Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge.When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/gas 9.At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges. Tear over the mozzarella and scatter with the remaining basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper.If you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your conventional oven – if not, cook them one by one on pieces of tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards the bottom of the oven (If you're going to cook your pizzas on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too big – otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre).

Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for ~{10%minutes}, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough. Place the dough in a lightly greased #bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to prove for ~{45%minutes}, or until doubled in size. For the sauce, peel and finely slice the @garlic, then pick the @basil leaves and finely chop the stalks. Heat @oil{1%tbsp} in a #pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the @tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Leave the sauce to tick away for around ~{20%minutes}, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes with a #wooden spoon. When the time’s up, taste, and season to perfection. To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls. Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about ~{15%minutes} – this will make them easier to roll it thinly. Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about ½cm thick. Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge. When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/gas 9. At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges. Tear over the @mozzarella and scatter with the remaining basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper. If you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your conventional oven – if not, cook them one by one on pieces of tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards the bottom of the oven (If you're going to cook your pizzas on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too big – otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre). Cook for ~{7-10%minutes}, until the pizzas are golden and crispy.

Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent, stirring occasionally. This step is crucial as it forms the base flavor of the goulash. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Then, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the sweet Hungarian paprika. This helps prevent the paprika from burning, which could cause a bitter taste. Add the diced beef shank or shin to the pot, stirring well to coat the meat with the paprika and onion mixture. Return the pot to the heat and cook the meat until it starts to brown slightly. Add the sliced carrots, bell peppers, dried marjoram, and caraway seeds to the pot. Stir everything together to combine the flavors. Pour in the beef stock, ensuring that the meat and vegetables are fully submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer gently for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender. If you choose to use tomatoes, add them about halfway through the cooking time. Taste the goulash and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper as needed. Serve the goulash hot, traditionally with a side of fresh bread or small dumplings (csipetke).

data/bronze/recipes/brendanmckenzie_recipes/european/french/croissants.source	croissants		60 grams butter,500 grams flour,50 grams sugar,2 tsp salt,1 tsp yeast,360 ml milk,345 grams butter,2 tbsp flour	Watch the video below and use the step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe before beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets. Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and begin to knead the dough. Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rest. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rest. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test. Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video below, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14×10-inch rectangle. The dough isn’t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step. In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video below. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn. If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn.I usually don’t have to. Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2ndand 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) At the end of the next step, you’ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared! Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8×20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer—I suggest keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Whisk the egg wash ingredients together.Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash. Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375°F (190°C). Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool. Croissants taste best the same day they’re baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking	"Cut the @butter{60%grams} in four 1tbsp pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment.

With the mixer running, slowly pour in the @milk{360%ml}. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes. The dough will be soft. It will (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.

Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball.

The butter layer should be firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften.

Egg wash: Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash.

Bake the croissants: Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 190°C.

Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool."	Watch the video below and use the step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe before beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for a #baking sheet{}. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets. Cut the @butter{60%g} in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the #bowl of an electric #stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the @flour{500%g}, @sugar{50%g}, @salt{2%tsp}, and @yeast{1%tsp}. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for ~{1%minute}. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the @milk{360%ml}. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and begin to knead the dough. Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional ~{5%minutes}, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for ~{5%minutes}. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rest. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rest. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test. Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured #silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured #parchment paper lined, or lightly floured #baking sheet{}. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video below, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for ~{30%minutes}. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14×10-inch rectangle. The dough isn’t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for ~{4%hours} or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) In a #large bowl{} using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the @butter{345%g} and @flour{2%tbsp} together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a #spoon or #small spatula{}, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for ~{30%minutes}. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step. In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured #counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a #pizza cutter or #sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video below. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn. If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for ~{30%minutes} before the 2nd turn.I usually don’t have to. Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for ~{30%minutes} before the 3rd turn. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for ~{4%hours} or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) At the end of the next step, you’ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared! Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8×20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer—I suggest keeping on the counter) for ~{1%hour}, then place in the refrigerator to rest for ~{1%hour} or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash. Bake until croissants are golden brown, about ~{20%minutes}. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375°F (190°C). Remove croissants from the oven and place on a #wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool. Croissants taste best the same day they’re baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to your liking.

Line a 9-inch square baking pan (I love this one and this one) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan. Set aside. Whisk the flour, 1 cup (85g) oats, brown sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and vanilla, and stir until the mixture resembles moist crumbly sand and no dry spots remain. You will have a little more than 3 cups of crust mixture, or about 520g. Press 2/3 of the mixture (about 2 cups/345g—doesn’t have to be exact) into the prepared baking pan. Press it into the pan (with your hands, a large spoon or spatula, or the bottom of a measuring cup) to form a crust. Bake for 10 minutes, and then remove from the oven to slightly cool. Place the cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside, within reach of the stove. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, combine the cherries, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cherries begin to release their juices—about 4 to 6 minutes. While the cherries continue to cook, carefully remove a couple of spoonfuls of the juice from the saucepan and add to the bowl of cornstarch. Using a fork, mix the cornstarch and cherry juice together until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir this mixture into the filling, then bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the filling has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the almond extract. Pour/spread the filling over the warm crust. Stir 2 Tablespoons oats into the remaining crumble mixture, then sprinkle it all over the filling, and lightly press it down with the back of a large spoon or flat spatula. Bake for about 40–50 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few jammy cherry specks!). Mine take about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. After about 1 hour, you can place the whole pan in the refrigerator to help speed things up. Whisk the icing ingredients together. Add more milk to thin out, if desired. Drizzle over cooled bars.

Remove from heat, and in a #large bowl combine half of the melted caramel with the toasted coconut. Stir until fully combined. Spread the remaining caramel into a thin layer onto the cookies. Next, using your hands, press the coconut mixture onto the caramel. Let the cookie cool. Melt the @dark chocolate{12%oz} in a double boiler and dip the bottom of the cookies into the chocolate and place them on a #wax paper-lined baking sheet. Use a #piping bag or a #fork to drizzle the remaining chocolate on top of the cookies. Let the cookies sit until the chocolate hardens before serving."

Preheat oven to 325°F/163°C. Line a large 17 x 12 inch (43 x 30 cm) baking or cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. To peel the almonds: Over high heat, bring a saucepan of water to a boil.Add the almonds and boil for 1 minute (no longer because they will soften). Drain and rinse with cold water to cool and stop them from cooking. Spread onto a towel and rub them until the peels come off. Dry well. Add the almonds to a food processor or blender and pulse until finely chopped. In a mixing bowl, stir together the almonds, flour and orange peel. To a small saucepan add the sugar, heavy cream corn syrup and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture comes to a rolling boil and the sugar is completely dissolved. Continue to simmer for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the mixture to the almond mix along with the vanilla. Stir until combined. Allow to cool until it is cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Using a teaspoon measuring spoon, portion out 1 teaspoon of dough and roll into a ball using your hands. Roll the balls as round as you can, this will ensure nice round cookies. If the dough seems dry and crumbly, simply put a ball of the dough your warm hand it will soften so you can shape. Place the dough balls 6-inches (15 cm) apart  on to the prepared baking sheet. They spread to 3-inches (7 ½ cm) in diameter. You'll need to work in batches to fit your baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. If they join together, use a sharp knife to separate while they are hot and soft on the baking sheet as they will harden very quickly. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes until they are no longer soft, then transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining dough. In a microwave safe bowl, add the chocolate and microwave in 10 second increments, stirring in between until melted. Be careful not to burn. Take a cooled cookie, spread the chocolate on one side, take another cookie and make a sandwich, press carefully as they are delicate. Repeat with all cookies.

Without chilling, the piped cookies will over-spread. If you chill the dough prior to shaping, the dough will be too cold/stiff to pipe. Line 2–3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2–2.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above. Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1–2-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it’s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1–2-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar. Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Bake the chilled cookies for 12–15 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes.

Cook the pizzelle according to the instructions that came with your iron. In general, they'll take between ~{45%seconds} and ~{2 1/2%minutes} to brown. Remove the pizzelle from the iron, and cool on a #rack. If desired, use a pair of #scissors to trim any ragged edges. Dust cooled pizzelle with @confectioners' sugar, if desired. Pizzelle are best eaten immediately, but leftovers can be stored for up to 1 week in an airtight container, or frozen for up to 1 month.

Set aside. In a large bowl using a handheld or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until completely smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extract (if using) and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. Dough will be a bit soft. If the dough seems too soft and sticky for rolling, add 1 more Tablespoon of flour. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Place each portion onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use more flour if the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it is evenly 1/4-inch thick. Lightly dust one of the rolled-out doughs with flour. Place a piece of parchment on top. (This prevents sticking.) Place the 2nd rolled-out dough on top. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours and up to 2 days. Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).

If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it—see me do this in the video below. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.) Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart.

Since we knew that the starch granules in flour mute the flavor of peanut butter we briefly turned our attention to an Internet sensation flourless peanut butter cookies made with just peanut butter sugar egg and sometimes a bit of baking soda. Indeed when we tried a sample batch of our cookies sans flour they tasted super peanut-y and baked up looking much like traditional peanut butter cookies. Why didnt these flourless cookies melt right off of the cookie sheet Because peanut butter contains approximately  percent carbohydrates and  percent protein components that absorb moisture and harden into a stable network in the heat of the oven. But without the sturdier structure that only starch from wheat flour can provide these cookies fell apart in our hands before we could even take a bite.  Many recipes for peanut butter sandwich cookies disappoint with soft dull-tasting cookies and overly sweet fillings.

Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil. Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

Cut 25g of the butter into cubes, add these to the bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the caster sugar, yeast and salt and stir to combine.  Beat the milk, warm water and egg together in a separate bowl and pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon to bring the ingredients together, then turn out the mixture onto the work surface and knead it with a dough scraper for 5 minutes, until you have a slightly sticky dough. Wrap the dough and chill it for 1 hour.  Place the remaining block of chilled butter between 2 sheets of baking paper and flatten it out with a rolling pin to a rectangle measuring about 33 x 19cm.  Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the chilled dough to a rectangle about 1cm thick and measuring 50 x 20cm. With a short end of the dough closest to you, lay the butter on top of the dough, so that it covers the bottom two thirds. Make sure that it is positioned neatly and almost reaches the sides.  Fold the exposed dough at the top (without the butter) down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom third of the dough (with butter) up over the dough – you will now have a sandwich of 2 layers of butter and 3 layers of dough. Pinch together the edges of the dough lightly to seal in the butter and turn the dough/butter parcel 90 degrees, so the long seam is on the left-hand side. Wrap the dough and chill it for 20 minutes to harden the butter.  With the seam still on the left, roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle, about 1cm thick and 50 x 20cm, as before. With a short end of the dough closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top. Put the dough back in the fridge for 20 minutes.  <strong>Make the crème pâtissière.</strong> While the dough is in the fridge, in a medium bowl and using a balloon whisk, whisk the caster sugar with the egg yolks, cornflour and 1 tablespoon of the milk until pale and combined.  Gently heat the remaining milk with the vanilla seeds in a small saucepan until it just comes to the boil. Pour the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisk until well combined. Return the mixture to the pan and heat it gently, whisking continuously, until the mixture thickens to a custard consistency. Pour the crème pâtissière into a bowl, cover the surface and leave it to cool. Then, chill it until set.  <strong>Finish the pain aux raisins.</strong> Remove the dough from the freezer, unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle about 1cm thick and 50 x 20cm, as before. With one of the short edges closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top. Roll out the dough to a 30cm square.  Spread the crème pâtissière over the dough, leaving a 2cm border on the side furthest from you.  Sprinkle the raisins, cinnamon and orange zest over the crème pâtissière, then starting from the edge furthest from you, roll the dough towards you into a spiralled sausage shape, keeping it as tight as possible – give the dough a gentle tug each time you roll to tighten it up and give it a little tension.

Use a sturdy spoon, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough	"Stir together 540 g to 600 g @bread flour{540%g}, @granulated sugar{1%Tbsp}, @instant yeast{2.25%tsp}, @salt{2.5%tsp}, and @lukewarm (90-110°F) water{379%g} in a #large bowl{}, starting with 540 g of the flour. Use a #sturdy spoon{}, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough.

If you’re kneading the dough by hand, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, using some of the additional 1/2 cup of flour called for. Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you, then press it away from you with the heels of your hands. Rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this fold-press-rotate process with a rhythmic, rocking motion for about ~{6%minutes}. When fully kneaded, the dough will be bouncy and smooth.

If you’re using your stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough at medium speed for about 7 minutes, until it’s smooth, elastic, and feels a bit bouncy. If the dough doesn’t form a ball that clears the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in just enough of the additional flour to make this happen.

Place the dough in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with @vegetable oil or cooking spray{}; the bowl you started with is fine. Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} or another airtight cover, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it's doubled in size, about 1 to ~{2%hours}. If your kitchen is particularly cold (below 65°F), place the bowl of dough in your turned-off oven with the oven light on.

Gently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6” x 8” oval.

Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.

Place the loaves, seam-side down, on a #baking sheet{} (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with @cornmeal{}; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.

Let the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for ~{45%minutes}. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.

For extra-crusty crust and a great rise, add steam to your oven as follows: While the oven is preheating, place an empty #cast-iron frying pan{} on the lowest rack. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in the microwave or on the stovetop.

When your bread is risen, use a #sieve{} to dust the loaves with a thin coat of flour. Then make three or four 1/2” deep diagonal slashes in each loaf; these slashes will help the bread rise evenly as it bakes. Place the bread in the oven and pour the boiling water into the frying pan below. Quickly shut the oven door. Wear good oven mitts during this process to shield your hands and arms from the steam.

Bake the bread for 20 to ~{25%minutes}, until the crust is golden brown and a loaf sounds hollow to the touch when you tap it on the bottom. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer.

Turn the oven off, crack the door open, and allow the bread to remain inside for an additional ~{5%minutes}; this helps keep the crust crisp. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack. It’s best not to cut into the bread until it’s cooled down a bit; cutting into hot bread can negatively affect its texture.

Store the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days. Freeze for longer storage."	Weigh your @bread flour{540%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. Stir together all of the ingredients (except the @cornmeal) in a #large bowl, starting with 4 1/2 cups of the flour. Use a sturdy #spoon, or your #stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle.

Place the dough in a #lightly greased bowl{} and let it rest, covered with a #reusable cover or plastic wrap{}, until it doubles in bulk. This will take about 2 to ~{2.5%hours} depending on the warmth of your kitchen.

Turn the dough out onto a clean surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into eight equal pieces.

To preshape the dough: Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the edges into the center. Pinch to seal and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

Starting with the first piece of dough you shaped, place it seam-side down on an unfloured surface. Use your cupped fingers and palm to roll the dough into a tight ball, moving your hand in a circular motion. The dough should stick slightly to the surface in order to create tension to yield a smooth exterior. If the dough is unmanageably sticky, add a very light dusting of flour; if the dough slides around on the surface without tightening, use a damp towel to clean and moisten the surface and try again.

Once shaped into a tight ball, place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

Cover the preshaped dough and allow it to rest for 10 to ~{15%minutes}.

Line a #baking sheet{} with #parchment{} and lightly grease the parchment; or sprinkle the parchment lightly with cornmeal, semolina, or farina, to prevent the bagels from sticking.

To shape the bagels: Working with one piece of dough at a time, use your finger to poke a hole through the center. Gently rotate the dough to expand the hole to 2"" to 3"" in diameter, forming a ring shape. Place the shaped bagel onto the prepared baking sheet. The hole will close up a bit; that’s OK.

Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Place the bagels on the baking sheet in a 3-2-3 arrangement to allow them to fit nicely on one pan.

Cover the bagels with a reusable cover or lightly greased plastic wrap and let them rest until they feel slightly puffy to the touch, about ~{30%minutes}.

While the bagels are resting, preheat the oven to 450°F. Combine the @water{1808%g} and @barley malt syrup or honey{42%g} in a wide, #shallow pot{}; the water should be at least 1.25"" deep. Bring the mixture to a boil.

To boil the bagels: Add bagels to the water two or three at a time to avoid crowding. Boil for ~{60%seconds}, then use a #dough whisk or slotted spoon{} to turn the bagels over. Boil for another ~{60%seconds} before removing from the water and placing on the prepared pan.

If adding a topping, such as @Everything bagel topping (optional){47%g}, brush each bagel with the @egg{1} and @water{1%Tbsp} (egg wash) and dip into a bowl of your desired topping before transferring back to the pan.

Bake the bagels until golden brown, 18 to ~{22%minutes}. Rotate the pan (front to back, back to front) halfway through baking to ensure even browning.

Remove the bagels from the oven and transfer them to a #cooling rack{} to cool.

Storage information: Prepared bagel sandwiches can be stored, well-wrapped in foil, in the refrigerator for up to two days or in the freezer for up to a month. (See “tips,” below, for reheating instructions.) Bagels that aren’t made into sandwiches can be stored, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days, or frozen for longer storage.

Tip: To bake your bagels first thing in the morning: Prepare the dough up through step 5 (complete the kneading process) and allow it to rise for just 1 hour. Continue following the recipe through step 12 (shaping the bagels). Immediately place the baking sheet with the prepared bagels, covered, into the refrigerator overnight (8 to 12 hours). The next morning, continue the recipe as written starting at step 14 (preheating the oven). Leave the bagels in the refrigerator until the water bath is boiling and the oven is preheated."	To make the starter: Weigh your @bread flour{120%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a #large bowl or the bowl of your #stand mixer, stir together the starter ingredients to make a shaggy dough, then use your hand to knead gently until thoroughly combined. (This may take about a minute; it's quite stiff.) Cover the bowl and let the starter rest at room temperature for 4 to 14 hours; it should expand.

However, if you prefer to work with volume measurements, please be sure to measure your flour the King Arthur way: gently spoon the flour into a cup, then sweep off any excess., In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir to combine. Once the mass is mostly homogenous, use a bowl scraper to further press and smear the dough, smoothing it slightly., Transfer the dough to a lightly greased container (such as a 2-quart dough-rising bucket). The dough should measure between 74°F and 78°F. Cover the container and set a 30-minute timer., To fold the dough: After 30 minutes, perform a bowl fold: Lift the side of the dough, stretching upward, then press it down into the middle. Repeat this motion, working around the dough, for a total of 8 to 12 stretches and folds. After the last fold, turn the dough over so that it’s seam-side down in the container. Cover and let it rest for 30 more minutes., After the rest, mark the height of the dough in the container with a large rubber band or a piece of tape. Place the dough in the refrigerator to rise for 8 to 24 hours., After the cold rise, allow the dough to warm slightly at room temperature, anywhere between 1 and 2 hours. By this point, the dough should have risen in volume 1 1/2 to 2 times., To preshape the baguettes: Lightly sprinkle the surface of the dough in the container with whole wheat flour, then use a bowl scraper to release the sides of the dough so that it can turn out without pulling or tearing. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly flour the top, then divide it into 3 equal pieces (about 250g each)., Use lightly floured hands to pat each piece of dough into a rough 6"" square, pressing gently to pop any air bubbles. Starting with the first piece of dough you handled, shape it into a tube: Fold in the left side and the right side to meet in the middle then press to gently seal. Starting at the top, fold the rectangle towards yourself in 3 motions, pressing gently after each fold, to create a cylinder with the seam-side down. The entire time you work, apply flour as needed to make sure the dough is moving easily on the work surface, with no wet bits threatening to stick. Repeat this process with the other 2 pieces of dough. Cover the preshaped dough and let them rest for 15 minutes., To shape the baguettes: Move a piece of preshaped dough to the center of the lightly floured surface and stretch it gently to elongate on the east/west axis, then pat it lightly to remove any bubbles. Next, fold the dough from the top down 2/3 of the way and pat to gently seal. Rotate the dough 180° and again fold toward you to bring the dough 2/3 of the way down; pat gently to seal. Last, make a gentle east/west divot in the middle of the dough and then fold the top of the dough down to the bottom edge and press to seal with the heel of your hand., With the seam-side down, place a single palm in the middle of the dough and roll it gently back and forth. With light pressure, a depression will form, turning the log into a dog bone shape. Next, add your second hand and roll the dough side to side, pushing it back and forth so that it travels across the work surface; slowly move your hands apart and toward the tips of the baguette, adding pressure so that the ends taper. If the dough is resistant, go back to the middle and take another pass. Aim for your baguettes to be 16"" to 18"" in length so that they fit comfortably on your baking stone or steel (use a half-sheet of parchment as your guide)., Once shaped, place the baguette seam-side up onto a baker’s couche or stiff cotton dish towel that’s been lightly dusted with whole wheat flour. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough., Cover the baguettes and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy. The loaves should look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but they will not have doubled in size. This should take about 45 to 60 minutes at room temperature (about 68°F); it could take as few as 30 minutes in a warm environment. Meanwhile, prepare your oven for baking., While the dough rises, preheat the oven to 500°F with a cast iron pan on the bottom of the oven, or on the lowest rack. (If you can fit two cast iron pans, even better; alternatively, use a 9"" x 13"" pan that you are comfortable reserving for this purpose; it may warp.) Place a baking steel or stone on the middle rack above the pans to preheat., Gently roll the proofed baguettes onto a transfer peel so that they're seam-side down, then nudge them onto a piece of parchment, still seam-side down. (If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment placed on an inverted baking sheet.) For the easiest scoring, chill the baguettes for 10 minutes in the refrigerator., Using a baker's lame held at about a 30° to 45° angle, make 1, 3, or 5 long lengthwise cuts in each baguette., To bake the baguettes: Load the baguettes into the oven. Use a baker’s peel, a rimless baking sheet, or an inverted baking sheet to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot steel or stone. Carefully pour about 1 cup of water into the cast iron pan(s) and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise and give them a lovely, shiny crust., Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 475°F., Bake the baguettes for 24 to 28 minutes, or until they're very deep golden brown. For the crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, prop the door open about 2"", and let the baguettes dry out for an additional 10 minutes. Remove baguettes from the oven and cool them on a rack.

Brioche should be a deep brown when done, should sound hollow when tapped, and will read 190°F at the center using an instant-read thermometer. (It's easy to underbake since it browns so quickly!) Remove the brioche from the oven, and after ~{10%minutes} remove it from the pan to cool completely on a #rack. To bake the mini brioches: Place the pan(s) onto a #baking sheet for easy handling, as shown; then nestle that baking sheet into another baking sheet, to protect the buns' bottoms from over-browning. Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F oven for ~{15-20%minutes} (tent after ~{10%minutes} if they're browning too quickly). Remove them from the oven, let stand for ~{5%minutes}, then turn them out onto a rack. To bake the loaves: Allow the loaves to rise until they've nearly reached the rim of the pan, about ~{3%hours}. Set the loaf pans on a baking sheet, for easy handling. Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for ~{30-35%minutes}, tenting with foil after ~{15-20%minutes}. Bake until the internal temperature reaches at least 190°F in the center, and up to 205°F for a crustier loaf. To make the glaze: Combine the @confectioners' sugar{3%Tbsp}, @vanilla{1%tsp}, and @salt{1%tsp}. Add enough @heavy cream{2%tsp} to make a pourable consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the baked loaves, if desired."

Mix until no dry patches of flour remain. Cover and let it rest overnight at room temperature, 12 to 16 hours., Day 2: Make the dough: Add the water to the preferment, then squeeze the preferment through your fingers to break it up. Next, holding your hand in a claw-like position, vigorously mix the preferment into the water until well combined. The mixture will look like foamy milk with some small pieces of preferment still visible., Add the flour, salt, and yeast, mixing well until no dry spots remain. Using a wet hand and a light touch, quickly work the dough against the side of the bowl until it begins to smooth out and is tacky., Once you’ve mixed your dough, let it rest, covered, for 20 minutes., To fold the dough: Using a wet hand or bowl scraper, reach down between the side of the bowl and the dough, as though you were going to lift the dough out. Instead of lifting, stretch the bottom of the dough up and over its top. Repeat 8 to 12 more times, working your way around the bowl. This process of stretching the dough, which takes the place of kneading, is called a bowl fold., Cover and let the dough rest for another 20 minutes, then perform another bowl fold., Let the dough rest for 20 minutes, then perform a coil fold: With wet hands, reach under the dough and stretch the middle upward until the dough releases from the dish. Roll it forward off your hands, allowing it to fold over (or “coil”) on itself. Rotate the bowl 90° (a quarter turn) and repeat 2 to 3 more times, until the dough resists stretching., Cover and let the dough rest at room temperature for 1 hour, or until it feels very puffy and marshmallowy., Use a bowl scraper to gently ease the dough out of the bowl and onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour, then divide the dough into 2 even pieces (650g each)., Gently preshape each piece of dough into a round. (See our post, How to preshape bread dough, for details.), Cover the preshaped dough and let it rest on a lightly floured surface for 15 minutes., Generously dust two 9"" x 3"" round or oval proofing baskets (brotforms) with flour. Shape each piece of dough into a boule or bâtard, then place them seam-side up in the prepared baskets., Cover the baskets and let the dough rise until it looks and feels marshmallowy and a small indentation remains when pressed with a floured finger, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 475°F with a baking steel or stone on the middle rack and an empty cast iron skillet or a cake pan filled with lava rocks on the rack below. If possible, adjust the stone and pan so that the skillet isn't directly under the stone, making it easier for steam to reach the baking bread., When ready to bake, gently invert the loaves side by side onto a sheet of parchment. Use a baker’s lame or razor blade to score the tops of the loaves., Load the loaves (still on the parchment) into the oven, placing them on the stone, and carefully pour about 1 cup (roughly 227g) warm water into the skillet., Bake the loaves for 32 to 38 minutes, until the crust is firm and medium golden brown.

Let the dough rest for ~{20%minutes}, then perform a coil fold. With wet hands, reach under the dough and stretch the middle upward until the dough releases from the dish. Roll it forward off your hands, allowing it to fold over (or “coil”) on itself. Rotate the bowl 90° (a quarter turn) and repeat 2 to 3 more times, until the dough resists stretching.

Cover and let the dough rest at room temperature for ~{1%hour}, or until it feels very puffy and marshmallowy.  

Use a bowl scraper to gently ease the dough out of the bowl and onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour, then divide the dough into 2 even pieces (650 g each).

Gently preshape each piece of dough into a round.

Cover the preshaped dough and let it rest on a lightly floured surface for ~{15%minutes}.

Generously dust two 9"" x 3"" #round or oval proofing baskets (brotforms){} with flour. Shape each piece of dough into a boule or bâtard, then place them seam-side up in the prepared baskets.

Cover the baskets and let the dough rise until it looks and feels marshmallowy and a small indentation remains when pressed with a floured finger, 45 minutes to ~{1%hour}. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 475°F with a baking steel or stone on the middle rack and an empty #cast iron skillet{} or a cake pan filled with lava rocks on the rack below. If possible, adjust the stone and pan so that the skillet isn't directly under the stone, making it easier for steam to reach the baking bread.

When ready to bake, gently invert the loaves side by side onto a sheet of #parchment{}. Use a #baker’s lame or razor blade{} to score the tops of the loaves.

Load the loaves (still on the parchment) into the oven, placing them on the stone, and carefully pour about 1 cup (roughly 227 g) warm water into the skillet. 

Bake the loaves for 32 to ~{38%minutes}, until the crust is firm and medium golden brown. Let the loaves cool completely before slicing. French bread is best eaten the day it's baked. Freeze for longer storage.

Tip: If you’d like, you can replace the generous 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast in the preferment with 1 tablespoon (14 g) sourdough culture for more flavor.

Tip: You can substitute up to 25% whole wheat in place of some of the all-purpose flour in the final dough without making any significant changes to hydration. To do this, make the preferment as written, then use 3 1/4 cups (390g) all-purpose flour and 1 cup plus 2 1/2 tablespoons (130 g) whole wheat flour in the dough. All other instructions remain the same."	"Weigh your @all-purpose flour{222%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

Day 1: The evening before you want to bake, make the preferment: In a #medium bowl, combine the @all-purpose flour, yeast, and water. Mix until no dry patches of flour remain. Cover and let it rest overnight at room temperature, 12 to 16 hours.

Day 2: Make the dough: Add the water to the preferment, then squeeze the preferment through your fingers to break it up. Next, holding your hand in a claw-like position, vigorously mix the preferment into the water until well combined. The mixture will look like foamy milk with some small pieces of preferment still visible.

Add the @all-purpose flour, salt, and yeast, mixing well until no dry spots remain. Using a wet hand and a light touch, quickly work the dough against the side of the bowl until it begins to smooth out and is tacky.

Once you’ve mixed your dough, let it rest, covered, for ~{20%minutes}.

To fold the dough: Using a wet hand or #bowl scraper, reach down between the side of the bowl and the dough, as though you were going to lift the dough out. Instead of lifting, stretch the bottom of the dough up and over its top. Repeat 8 to 12 more times, working your way around the bowl. This process of stretching the dough, which takes the place of kneading, is called a bowl fold.

Cover and let the dough rest for another ~{20%minutes}, then perform another bowl fold.

After this first rise, you may choose to refrigerate the dough for up to six days, which will help develop its flavor.

With a rack in the center, preheat the oven to 500°F to 550°F with a baking steel or stone inside. Make sure the oven is at least 500°F for a full ~{30%minutes} before baking your pizza, in order for the steel or stone to preheat thoroughly.

Divide the dough in half. Working with one piece at a time,transfer the dough to a well-floured surface.

Stretch and fold it, as follows: Holding onto the dough at both ends, pull one end away from the other, then fold it back onto itself. Repeat on the other side so that all four corners of the dough have been stretched and folded.

Next,pull the ends of the dough toward the middle, then turn it over. Using your fingers, pull the dough under itself to make a smooth, round ball with the seams tucked into the bottom. Repeat with the other piece of dough.Place each ball seam-side down into a floured #bowl{}.

Cover the bowls and allow the dough to proof (rise) for ~{45%minutes} to an hour, while your oven preheats.

Working with one piece at a time, transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and dust the top with flour. Use your fingertips to gently depress the surface, being careful not to touch the outer edge of the crust; you want it to remain thick.

Lift up the crust and use your knuckles to gently stretch it into a circle about 10"" to 12"" in diameter. Move it to a well-floured #pizza peel{} or floured sheet of parchment. If you're using parchment, trim the excess around the dough to prevent it from burning.

Lightly sauce the dough, then add your toppings of choice. For special toppings easy to prepare in advance see ""tips,"" below.

Turn on the top broiler in your preheated oven and transfer the pie to the steel or stone. Be sure there's at least 8"" of space between the surface of the pizza and the broiler.If you have an oven with the broiler on the bottom (usually in the bottom compartment of the oven), or on top in a smaller, separate compartment, make sure there's at least 8"" between the broiler and the cooking surface. If there isn't, don't use the broiler. Your pizza will still be great without being broiled, though it may take a few more minutes to bake., Gently slide the pizza (or pizza and parchment) onto the steel or stone. Bake the pizza for approximately ~{6%minutes} on the steel (or ~{7%minutes} on the stone), until bubbly and charred on the edges. Remove the pizza from the oven and top it with freshly grated Parmesan, if desired., Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.

Tip: Substitute an equal amount of all-purpose flour for a slightly less chewy crust. No other changes are necessary.

Tip: To make the ""Veg Vinaigrette Pizza"": Top your pie with red sauce and add a sprinkle of grated mozzarella followed by roasted butternut squash or roasted sweet potato. Bake as directed. Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with your favorite vinaigrette. When the vinaigrette hits the hot surface it blooms — i.e., becomes super aromatic. Top with quick-pickled red onions (or other pickled items in your fridge, like capers) or radishes for color, and finish with a sprinkle of feta or crumbled blue cheese.

Tip: To make the ""Smoky-Sweet Pizza"": Top your pie with a thin layer of BBQ sauce and sprinkle with grated mozzarella. Add sliced pears, bacon that’s been cooked about halfway (pliable, not crispy), and thinly sliced scallions that have been flash-fried in oil. Bake the pizza as directed. To finish, drizzle with BBQ sauce from a squirt bottle, or BBQ sauce mixed with tomato sauce (roughly equal measures of each).

Tip: The maximum temperature rating for most parchment paper is below 500°F, and at temperatures between 450°F and 500°F parchment’s exposed edges begin to char. To be safe, keep a close eye on anything being cooked at temperatures above 450°F (especially anything on an upper rack). Burned edges can also be minimized by trimming away excess parchment before baking."	Weigh your @bread flour{247%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

In a large bowl, combine the starter ingredients	"Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a #large bowl{}, combine the starter ingredients.

To make the starter: Mix @water{113%g}, @instant yeast{1/16%tsp}, and @all-purpose flour{120%g} together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become bubbly.

To make the dough: Mix and knead @water{255%g}, starter, @instant yeast{1.5%tsp}, @all-purpose flour{420%g}, and @salt{2%tsp} together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.

Place the dough in a lightly greased #medium-sized bowl{}, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for ~{45%minutes}. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three equal pieces.

Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to ~{1%hour}, if that works better with your schedule.

Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.

Turn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.

With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16"" log. Your goal is a 15"" baguette, so 16"" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical ""pointy"" end.

Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy (""marshmallow-y"" is the term we use in our baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68°F).

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a #cast iron pan{} on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.

If your baguettes have risen in a #dish towel or couche{}, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece of #parchment{}, seam-side down. If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment (seam-side down) and then place the parchment on a baking sheet.

Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.

Load the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust.

Bake the baguettes - on the pan, or on a stone - for 24 to ~{28%minutes}, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2"", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.

Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead — using your hands, a stand mixer, or a bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, smooth dough., Place the dough in a lightly greased container, and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it's just about doubled in bulk., To make the filling: While the dough is rising, make the filling by stirring together the sugar, cinnamon, and flour., Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface., Roll and pat the dough into a rough rectangle approximately 6"" x 20""., Brush the dough with the egg/water mixture and sprinkle it evenly with the filling and raisins, leaving a bare strip about 1"" wide along one short edge; this will make the log you're about to roll easier to seal., Starting with the short end that's covered with filling, roll the dough into a log. Pinch the ends to seal, and pinch the long seam closed., Transfer the log, seam-side down, to a lightly greased 9"" x 5"" loaf pan.

data/bronze/recipes/nicholaswilde_recipes/cook/italian/Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo.source	Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo		4 oz fettuccine,3 Tbsp butter,1 cup heavy whipping cream,0.25 cup Parmesan,0.25 cup Romano cheese,1  egg yolk,0.125 tsp salt,1 dash pepper,1 dash nutmeg,some  parsley (optional)	Cook the fettuccine according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Stir in the cream, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, egg yolks, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Editor's Tip: Be sure to choose a saucepan that will fit the sauce and the cooked fettuccine. Everything will be combined in the pan before serving. If you prefer a garlicky Alfredo sauce, feel free to add minced garlic or garlic powder in this step. Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F. Do not boil the sauce. Editor's Tip: An instant-read meat thermometer is useful for making Alfredo sauce with eggs. Monitoring the temperature is the best way to ensure the egg yolks won't get hot enough to scramble. Drain the fettuccine and add it to the saucepan with the Alfredo sauce and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. If you'd like, sprinkle parsley over the fettuccine Alfredo. Editor's Tip: After stirring the pasta, sauce and cheese, the thick sauce and cheese should cling to the pasta. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, let the pasta simmer in the sauce for a few minutes before serving	"To start, cook the @fettuccine{4%oz} according to the package instructions. While the pasta is cooking, you can prepare the Alfredo sauce.

In a #saucepan{}, melt @butter{3%Tbsp} over medium-low heat. Be sure to choose a saucepan that will fit all of your Alfredo sauce with the cooked fettuccine—everything will be combined in it.

Pour the cup of @heavy whipping cream{1%cup} into the pot, stirring to combine. While heavy whipping cream and heavy cream are typically used interchangeably for some cooks, they do contain a slight difference in milk fat content, so the consistency might be a bit different if you decide to substitute.

Once combined, sprinkle in 1/4 cup @Parmesan{1/4%cup} cheese, all the @Romano cheese{1/4%cup}, the lightly beaten @egg yolk{1}, @salt{1/8%tsp}, @pepper{1%dash} and @nutmeg{1%dash}. The extra dash of ground nutmeg elevates the flavor along with the usual salt and pepper combo, making the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce stand out among the rest.

Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F; do not bring to a boil.

Drain the cooked fettuccine pasta, then add it to the saucepan with the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce and the remaining Parmesan cheese. Stir together the pasta, sauce and cheese until fully combined. The thick sauce and extra cheese should cling to the pasta nicely. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, you can let the pasta simmer for a few minutes to thicken it up before serving.

If desired, sprinkle with @parsley (optional){}. Serve with a slice of garlic bread or, even better, a batch of Copycat Olive Garden Breadsticks."	Cook the @fettuccine{4%oz} according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a #saucepan, melt the @butter{3%Tbsp} over medium-low heat.

You can substitute part-skim ricotta for the whole-milk ricotta. Frozen whole-leaf spinach is easiest to squeeze dry, but frozen chopped spinach will work. Squeezing the spinach should remove ½ to ⅔ cup of liquid; you should have ⅔ cup of finely chopped spinach. Our tomato-butter sauce isn't strictly canonical; if you'd prefer a more traditional accompaniment, substitute our   Simple Tomato Sauce   or browned butter and fresh sage. Serve with a simple salad. FOR THE GNUDI: Line rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. Spread ricotta in even layer over towels; set aside and let sit for 10 minutes. Place flour, Parmesan, panko, salt, pepper, and lemon zest in large bowl and stir to combine. Process spinach in food processor until finely chopped, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer spinach to bowl with flour mixture. Grasp paper towels and fold ricotta in half; peel back towels. Rotate sheet 90 degrees and repeat folding and peeling 2 more times to consolidate ricotta into smaller mass. Using paper towels as sling, transfer ricotta to bowl with spinach mixture. Discard paper towels but do not wash sheet. Add egg whites to bowl and mix gently until well combined. Transfer heaping teaspoons of dough to now-empty sheet (you should have 45 to 50 portions). Using your dry hands, gently roll each portion into 1-inch ball. FOR THE SAUCE: Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, swirling saucepan occasionally, until butter is very foamy and garlic is pale golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, add tomatoes and vinegar; cover and set aside. Bring 1 quart water to boil in Dutch oven. Add 1½ teaspoons salt. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer all gnudi to water. Return water to gentle simmer. Cook, adjusting heat to maintain gentle simmer, for 5 minutes, starting timer once water has returned to simmer (to confirm doneness, cut 1 dumpling in half; center should be firm). While gnudi simmer, add salt and pepper to sauce and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are warmed through and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Divide sauce evenly among 4 bowls. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, remove gnudi from pot, drain well, and transfer to bowls with sauce. Garnish with basil and extra Parmesan.

Set potatoes either on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, on a baking sheet lined with a layer of salt, or directly on the oven's racks. Bake until completely tender throughout when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a work surface. Using tongs to hold hot potatoes, slice each in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop potato flesh into a ricer or food mill fitted with the finest disk. Press potato flesh onto a clean work surface, spreading it into an even layer, and allow steam to escape for a few minutes. Drizzle egg yolks all over, if using. Scoop 1/2 cup flour into a fine-mesh sieve and tap to dust flour all over potatoes. Using a pastry blender or bench scraper, chop down repeatedly all over to cut flour and egg into potato. Using a bench scraper, gather up shaggy potato mass and pat into a loose ball. Press ball flat with hands, then fold in half using bench scraper and press down again. Scoop remaining 1/4 cup flour into sieve and dust all over potato dough. Continue to gently fold and press, just until a uniform dough comes together. (Make sure to simply fold and press down; avoid the smearing motion more commonly used when kneading bread.) Dust potato dough all over with flour and gently form into a log. Clean work area well and dust with fresh flour. Using bench scraper, slice off a roughly 1-inch-thick portion of dough and roll into a snake about 1/2 inch thick; use a light touch as you roll, trying to use your palms more than your fingers, and dusting as necessary with flour to prevent sticking. Using bench scraper, cut snake into 1-inch portions, trimming off uneven ends as necessary. Transfer gnocchi to a well-floured area or baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough. Bring a large pot of very well-salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it foams. Add sage and fry until very aromatic and butter begins to lightly brown; remove from heat. Using a bench scraper or slotted spatula to scoop them up, transfer gnocchi to boiling water. Stir once very gently with a spider or slotted spoon to prevent sticking. When gnocchi begin to float to the surface, wait about 20 seconds, then taste one; it should be soft yet cooked through, without any raw-flour flavor.

Pour the  @Rice Krispies Cereal{7%cups} into the greased bowl and set it aside.

Begin to melt @unsalted butter{6%Tbsp} over low heat in a #medium or large saucepan{}.

Add the @marshmallows{16%oz} to the saucepan and stir.

Continue to stir often, until about 75 percent of the marshmallows are melted.

Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir, smashing the marshmallows using a #rubber spatula{} or the back of a wooden spoon, until the marshmallows completely melt and become smooth.

Note: We recommend taking the marshmallows off the heat before they are completely melted, so you will not overheat the marshmallows. The residual heat from the melted marshmallows will heat the unmelted marshmallows slowly, allowing them to melt without getting too hot. When marshmallows are overheated, the sugar crystallizes, turning into hard candy. Overheated marshmallows will make your treats hard to bite into.

Pour the marshmallows over the cereal and toss to combine.

Note: We recommend pouring the marshmallows over the cereal instead of adding them to the pan. If the cereal is poured into the hot pan, the crisp rice may become soft if it gets too hot. Your treats may taste stale immediately after they are made because the cereal will be soft.

Once the cereal is mixed with the melted marshmallows, pour it into a well-buttered 9 x 13 pan.

GENTLY spread it into an even layer. Do not compress the mixture or your treats will be dense and hard.

Allow the treats to cool for at least ~{30%minutes} before cutting into rectangles or squares.

Notes

European-style salted butter contains more butterfat than American-style butter adding richness to the treats. Salted butter balances out the sweetness.

We recommend using Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallows. They have great texture and flavor. We found store-brand marshmallows to be stickier. If you use store-brand marshmallows, we recommend adding up to one additional cup of Rice Krispies Cereal.

Store your treats in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

Do NOT refrigerate your treats. They will become stale-tasting if stored in the fridge.

You can freeze the treats. Wrap them well, and freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, bring them to room temperature and let them sit, wrapped, for a few hours. Then unwrap and enjoy.

Do NOT overheat your marshmallows. This is key to making soft and chewy Rice Krispie Treats, not hard treats.

Do NOT compact the cereal treat mixture into your pan or you will end up with very dense, hard treats. Gently press the mixture into the pan."

Rub in the chilled butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add enough cold water to form a dough (about 6 tablespoons). On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle (approx. 15cm x 40cm).  Scatter half of the frozen butter over the bottom two-thirds of the dough. Fold down the top third and fold up the bottom third as if folding a letter. Turn the folded dough by 90 degrees and roll it out into a rectangle again. Repeat the process of adding the remaining frozen butter and fold as before.  Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes before using. For the crème pâtissière, pour the milk and cream into a pan. Add the vanilla paste and bring just to the boil, then take off the heat.  Whisk the egg yolks, caster sugar and cornflour together in a bowl. Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture whisking continuously.  Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously until the cream thickens. Cook over a low heat for 2 - 3 minutes to cook out the flour.

You can follow my recipe for an all butter flaky pie crust, use your favorite recipe, or a store-bought crust. To make the tart cherry pie filling: add frozen tart cherries, sugar, cornstarch, flour and almond extract to a large pot and place over medium heat. After 5 minutes or so, the cherries will thaw, begin to break down and the sugar will melt. Stir frequently during this time. Add in butter and amaretto and continue to stir. After another 5-10 or so minutes, the mixture will begin to thicken and start to bubble along the edges. Once the filling begins to stick slightly to the back of your spoon, remove it from the heat and set aside to cool off. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. While your oven preheats, make the dutch crumble topping: in a medium bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar and oats. Add in the melted butter and stir together with a fork until it begins to form into crumbles and resembles clumpy wet sand. You may need to use your hands/fingers to form into nice crumbles. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 5 minutes or until ready to use. Remove pie pan with pie crust from the refrigerator and place pie pan onto a large baking sheet. I do this to avoid any spillage that may happen as the pie filling bubbles and bakes. Pour cooled tart cherry pie filling into the crust, then top filling with the dutch crumble topping. Bake for 1 hour-1 hour 15 minutes or until the filling is very bubbly and the crumble is slightly golden brown. Check pie after 30 minutes to make sure the crust isn’t burning. If it is getting too golden brown, simply cover pie edges with foil or pie shield. Allow pie to cool on a wire rack until completely cooled before cutting into it (this is annoying, but if you cut into it before then the pie filling won't be set). The longer the pie rests, the easier it is to serve! Can be made a few days ahead of time. Pie is best served at room temp or just slightly warm. Serves 9. Great with vanilla bean ice cream. Enjoy!

Grease a 9x5-inch metal loaf pan with butter.  In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt on medium-high speed until pale and very fluffy, stopping once during mixing to scrape down the paddle and bowl, 6 to 8 minutes total. (You might think it’s done before that time, but keep going all the way.)  Scrape down the paddle and sides of the bowl. On medium-high speed, beat in the eggs and yolk one at a time, scraping down the paddle and the bowl after each addition. The batter should look very fluffy, creamy, and emulsified (if not, your eggs or butter may have been not at room temperature—let the mixture come to room temperature then try mixing it again).  Scrape down the paddle and sides of the bowl. In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and vanilla until lump-free and totally smooth.  Add half of the sour cream and mix on medium-low until just incorporated, about 15 seconds. Add half of the flour and mix until just incorporated, about 15 seconds. Repeat with the remaining sour cream and flour. Using a flexible rubber spatula, scrape down the paddle and the bowl and mix the batter a few times to make sure everything is evenly combined.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and roughly level the batter with the spatula. With a butter knife or offset spatula, swirl the knife through the batter to make sure it is evenly distributed into the pan with no big air pockets and give the pan a few swift taps against the counter.

Bake until the crust is deeply browned, the loaf rises and splits, and the cake feels firm and set when you gently press the top, 60 to 70 minutes.

Butter and flour two 8-inch, 1 9x13-inch, or 3 6-inch round pans with coconut oil or vegan cooking spray and dust with gluten-free flour (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size). Shake out excess. Set aside. Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl by mixing flaxseed meal and water and let rest for 5 minutes. To the flax eggs, add oil and maple syrup and whisk to combine. Next, add applesauce, sugars, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon and whisk to combine. Add lesser amount of almond milk (3/4 cup or 180 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and stir. Add grated carrot and stir. Then add almond flour and gluten-free flour blend and stir. The batter should be thick but pourable. If too thick, add remaining almond milk 1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). If adding walnuts, add at this time and stir. Divide evenly among cake pan(s). Bake for 40-50 minutes or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. When you press on the top, it shouldn’t feel too spongy, so don’t be afraid of over-baking! The gluten-free blend just takes a little longer to bake. Also, note that the size of pan you use will vary baking time. Remove from oven and let rest in the pans for 15 minutes. Then carefully run a knife along the edges and gently invert onto cooling racks to let cool completely. NOTE: This cake needs to cool completely. It benefits from plenty of airflow, and the flavors develop as the cooling process goes on. If short on time, you can speed the cooling by placing the cakes in the refrigerator or freezer until very cool to the touch. Once cooled, you can serve as is or frost!

If your 8” pans aren’t at least 2” deep, use 9” pans., Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess	"To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the center. Lightly grease two 8” x 2” or 9” x 2” round cake pans; for extra protection against sticking, line the bottom of the pans with parchment rounds (you can cut these yourself or use precut 8” or 9” rounds), and grease the parchment. If your 8” pans aren’t at least 2” deep, use 9” pans.

Weigh your @all-purpose flour{240%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

In a #small bowl{}, combine the flour, @salt{1.25%tsp}, and @baking powder{2%tsp}. Set aside.

In a #large mixing bowl{}, either using an #electric hand mixer or stand mixer{} with whisk attachment, beat the @eggs{4%large}, @granulated sugar{2%cups}, @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, and @almond extract (optional){1/8%tsp}, until thickened and light gold in color, about ~{2%minutes} at medium-high speed. If your stand mixer doesn’t have a whisk attachment, beat for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. The batter should fall in thick ribbons from the beaters, whisk, or paddle.

Add the dry ingredients to the mixture in the bowl and mix — by hand or on low speed of a mixer — just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix again briefly, to fully incorporate any residual flour or sticky bits.

In a saucepan set over medium heat or in the microwave, bring the @whole milk{1%cup} just to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the @unsalted butter{57%g} and @vegetable oil{1/3%cup}, stirring by hand until the butter has melted.

Slowly mix the hot milk-butter-oil mixture into the batter, stirring on low speed of a mixer until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth.

Divide the batter evenly between the two pans. You’ll use about 2 3/4 cups (about 580 g) in each.

Bake the cakes until the edges are pulling away from the sides of the pan, a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set. This should take 26 to ~{30%minutes} for two 9” pans, or 38 to 42 minutes for two 8” pans; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the cakes should read 205°F. Remove the cakes from the oven, carefully loosen the edges, and allow them to cool for ~{15%minutes} in the pans. Then turn them out of the pans and transfer them to a #cooling rack{}, right-side up, to cool to room temperature.

To make the frosting: In a #large mixing bowl{} or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together — by hand or mixer — the @cocoa powder{106%g}, 1 cup (113g) of the @confectioners’ sugar{454%g}, and the @salt{1/4%tsp}. Stir in the @hot water{74%g} and @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, scraping the bowl if necessary.

Add the @unsalted butter{284%g} and remaining confectioners’ sugar, stirring to combine. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the frosting at medium-high speed for 1 to ~{2%minutes}, until lightened in color and fluffy, stopping halfway through to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. When the frosting is ready, scoop out a bit on your #spatula{}; does it seem nicely spreadable? If it's too stiff, beat in water (1 teaspoon at a time) until it's the consistency you want.

To assemble the cake: Place one of the cake layers on a serving plate; tuck pieces of waxed or parchment paper underneath the edge of the cake to keep the plate clean. Spread the bottom layer with about 1 cup of frosting, enough to make a 1/4” to 1/2”-thick layer. Center the second layer bottom-side up (for a flat top) over the frosted layer and press gently to set it in place.

If your schedule permits, place the cake in the refrigerator or freezer, uncovered, for at least ~{30%minutes} (or up to 2 hours) to firm it up. This will make the layers less likely to slide around as you work, and the cake won’t shed crumbs as you frost. If you’re pressed for time, you can skip this step.

To finish the cake: For the best-looking cake, do the frosting in two steps. First, spread a very thin layer of frosting around the sides and across the top; this is called a crumb coat. You should be able to see the cake through the frosting in spots, it’s that thin. Refrigerate the cake for ~{20%minutes} to let this layer set. Again, skip this step if time is a factor.

Once the cake is chilled, use the remaining frosting to coat it thoroughly and evenly; our cake styling guide offers six pro-style options for ""styling"" your cake. If you have any leftover frosting, you can use it to pipe decorations on the top and/or around the base.

Store the cake, covered, at room temperature, or in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot. Let it come to room temperature before serving. For tips on slicing, see The best way to cut cake."	No Cooklang format found.

You should have a little over 1 cup. Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until you’re left with 1/2 cup (about 135g) or slightly more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25–35 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room temperature before adding to the cake batter. (See Notes for further make-ahead instructions.) Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.) Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired.

To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling. Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup crumbs. Set aside. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners’ sugar, strawberry powder, 1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting. First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides.

Storage information: Store cake, covered, at room temperature for several days. For longer storage, wrap airtight and freeze.

Note: There are a LOT of apples in this cake, by design. Some types of apples may not cook down as much as others, causing the batter to overflow a 9"" x 5"" pan. The filling has been updated to reduce the amount of apples from 4 to 3 1/2 cups, leaving the remaining ingredients the same. If you want a cake that's packed with apples, use the full 4 cups (452g) and put your pan on a parchment-lined baking sheet to catch any potential spills as the cake bakes.

Note: This cake can also be baked in a 9"" x 5"" loaf pan or a 9"" x 4"" x 4"" loaf pan; bake the cake for the full 65 to 75 minutes or a paring knife inserted into the center comes out clean.

If you’d like to use a 9×13 pan, I’d recommend baking at 350 for at least 30 minutes and adding additional time as needed.

Note: If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, you can sub an equal volume of 1 part milk to sour cream or Greek yogurt. In a pinch, you can sub 1 cup of buttermilk for 1 cup of milk (ideally whole milk, but any kind will work) with 1 tablespoon of milk replaced with vinegar."	"Preheat oven to 375 F.

Grease and line the cake tins with butter and baking paper. Weigh the eggs – 3 medium eggs in their shells weigh around 175g – then use this same weight for the butter, sugar and flour. Put the soft (but not oily) butter into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a food-mixer and beat well with a wooden spoon or the whisk attachment until very creamy and mayonnaise-like. Scrape down any butter mixture from the sides of the bowl with a plastic spatula, then gradually beat in the sugar a couple of tablespoons at a time. Scrape the mixture off the sides of the bowl again and beat well for 1 minute or until the mixture looks very light and fluffy. Scrape down the mixture again. Break the 3 eggs into a small jug, add the ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract and beat with a fork just until the eggs are broken up. Gradually add to the butter mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. If the mixture looks like it might be ‘splitting’ or curdling, rather than appearing smooth and creamy, stir in a tablespoon of the flour with each of the last two additions of egg. Sift the rest of the flour onto the mixture. Start to gently fold in the flour with a large metal spoon or plastic spatula and after two or three movements add the warm water. Keep folding in until the flour is well mixed in and there are no streaks. Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins - if you want to be really precise, use your scales, or just do it by eye, then spread it evenly. Bake for 20–25 minutes until the sponges are a light golden brown, and starting to shrink back from the sides of the tin. (Check the sponges after 15 minutes and if they aren't baking evenly rotate the trays.) Check that the sponge springs back when lightly pressed in the middle. When cooked, take them out of the oven and run a round-bladed knife around the inside of each tin to loosen the sponge. Leave for a minute to firm up, then carefully turn out the cakes onto a wire rack. Leave until they are completely cooled. If you are using cream, put a bowl and whisk (or whisk attachment) in the fridge to chill. To assemble the cake, set one sponge crust-side down on a serving plate. Using the back of a tablespoon, evenly spread the sponge with the 6 tablespoons of raspberry jam. Pour the cream, if using, into the chilled bowl and whip with the chilled whisk or attachment until it thickens and soft peaks form when you lift out the whisk. Spoon the cream onto the cake and then gently smooth it evenly over the jam. Top with the second sponge, crust-side up, and dust with icing sugar.<br><br><em>Photography: David Munns © Hodder & Stoughton</em>	"Preheat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / 350°F / Gas 4.

Weigh the eggs – 3 medium @eggs{3%medium} in their shells weigh around 175 g – then use this same weight for the @unsalted butter{175%g}, @granulated sugar{175%g} and @self-raising flour{175%g}.

Put the soft (but not oily) butter into a #large mixing bowl{} or the bowl of a food mixer and beat well with a wooden spoon or the whisk attachment until very creamy and mayonnaise-like. Scrape down any butter mixture from the sides of the bowl with a #plastic spatula{}, then gradually beat in the sugar a couple of tablespoons at a time. Scrape the mixture off the sides of the bowl again and beat well for ~{1%minute} or until the mixture looks very light and fluffy. Scrape down the mixture again.

Break the 3 eggs into a small jug, add the 3/4 teaspoon @vanilla{3/4%tsp} extract and beat with a #fork{} just until the eggs are broken up. Gradually add to the butter mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. If the mixture looks like it might be 'splitting' or curdling, rather than appearing smooth and creamy, stir in a tablespoon of the flour with each of the last two additions of egg.

Sift the rest of the flour onto the mixture. Start to gently fold in the flour with a #large metal spoon or plastic spatula{} and after two or three movements add the @warm water{1%Tbsp}. Keep folding in until the flour is well mixed in and there are no streaks.

Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins - if you want to be really precise, use your scales, or just do it by eye, then spread it evenly.

Bake for 20 to ~{25%minutes} until the sponges are a light golden brown, and starting to shrink back from the sides of the tin. (Check the sponges after 15 minutes and if they aren't baking evenly rotate the trays.) Check that the sponge springs back when lightly pressed in the middle.

When cooked, take them out of the oven and run a #round-bladed knife{} around the inside of each tin to loosen the sponge. Leave for ~{1%minute} to firm up, then carefully turn out the cakes onto a #wire rack{}. Leave until they are completely cooled.

If you are using @whipping cream (optional){150%ml}, put a bowl and whisk (or whisk attachment) in the fridge to chill.

To assemble the cake, set one sponge crust-side down on a serving plate. Using the back of a tablespoon, evenly spread the sponge with the 6 tablespoons of @raspberry jam{6%Tbsp}.

Pour the cream, if using, into the chilled bowl and whip with the chilled whisk or attachment until it thickens and soft peaks form when you lift out the whisk. Spoon the cream onto the cake and then gently smooth it evenly over the jam. Top with the second sponge, crust-side up, and dust with @confectioners' sugar{}."

Grease a 9x13 inch cake pan* with nonstick spray or rub with butter. Make the streusel: In a large bowl, whisk together 3 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons cinnamon. Melt 1 cup butter in a small bowl in the microwave. Pour into the larger bowl and stir the butter into the flour. You should end up with a bowl of what looks like wet sand, with lots of big chunks. Don't try to smooth it out. See photo. For the cake: In a large bowl or stand mixer, whisk together 2 and 1/4 cups flour, 1 and 1/4 cups sugar, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Chop 3/4 cup softened butter into chunks. You want the butter to sit out of the fridge for several minutes to that it's not rock-hard, but don't let it soften so much that it's completely creamy. Add the chopped butter and 1/2 cup sour cream to the flour mixture. Use the paddle attachment (or electic beaters) to blend the butter in. Eventually the butter will moisten the flour and it will all come together in a ball. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Don't over mix, just beat until all the butter is incorporated. In another large bowl, whisk together 4 eggs, 1 cup sour cream, and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Beat well until the eggs are well blended. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture in 3 additions, beating for about 20 seconds after each one. Once all the egg mixture is added, beat for another 1 minute until the batter is light and fluffy. Spread 2 cups of batter into the bottom of your prepared cake pan. Sprinkle 1 cup of streusel evenly over the top, breaking up any too-large pieces with your hands. Spread another 2 cups batter on top and spread it around as best you can. Add another 1 cup streusel on top. Add the rest of the batter and spread evenly. Evenly spread another 2 cups of streusel on top of the cake. Do NOT add all the remaining streusel! There will be some left over. Spread the remaining streusel on a baking sheet to dry out a little bit. Bake the cake at 350 for 25 minutes. Do this next part fast. Remove the cake from the oven and shut the oven door. Use your hands to sprinkle all the remaining streusel on top of the cake, focusing on any areas where the cake batter has puffed up from the center. Move quickly! Get the cake back in the oven as soon as you can, and keep the oven door shut as much as possible. Bake for another 20-25 minutes.* The total bake time for the cake should be about 45-50 minutes, depending on your oven and whether you use a glass or metal pan. Test the cake with a toothpick. It is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with no wet batter on it. The cake should not wobble around at all when you shake the pan. Let the cake cool on a wire rack for at least 15-20 minutes for cutting into it. Make the icing: In a medium bowl, beat 1/4 cup butter until smooth. (I actually did it by hand with a whisk. You can do this if your butter is ultra soft.) Add 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup milk, and 2 cups powdered sugar. Beat with a mixer or by hand until very smooth. Drizzle the icing over the cake. You can either drizzle it over the whole cake or drizzle each individual serving. I like to drizzle about half the icing over the whole cake, and then save the rest of drizzling over each serving. The cake is best served warm! Zap individual servings in the microwave for 10-20 seconds if you are serving after the cake has cooled. This cake will keep well covered on the counter for 2-3 days.

Butter and flour (or generously spray with a non-stick cooking spray) a 10-cup bundt pan (*see note). In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In a liquid measuring cup (or a small bowl) whisk together the sour cream and milk. Set aside. In the bowl of a electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl and an electric hand mixer), beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, ribbon-like and slightly lightened up; 2 to 3 minutes. With the mixer running on medium-low speed, gradually add in the sugar. Raise the speed to medium-high and continue beating together until lightened up in both color and texture; 4 to 5 minutes. The color should turn very pale (almost white) and texture should look fluffy. Add the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add in the vanilla and beat together for one minute. On lowest speed, add in one-third of the flour mixture and mix until mostly combined. Add in half of the sour cream/milk mixture and lightly stir until almost mixed in. Continue with adding another one-third of the flour mixture, followed by the remaining sour cream and ending with the last third of flour mixture. Mix until just combined and a smooth batter forms. Do not overmix. With a rubber spatula, give the batter one good, final stir to make sure that everything is well incorporated. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the batter from the bowl and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the milk, butter and sugar and heat in the microwave until the butter has melted. Whisk to dissolve the sugar. Add in the cocoa powder and stir really well until there are no lumps and a very thick chocolate paste forms. Add in the baking soda and stir again. Take a few tablespoons from the reserved vanilla cake batter and stir really well into the chocolate paste to lighten it up. Add the remaining reserved cake batter into the chocolate mixture and fold until evenly incorporated and no light streaks remain. (Note: The following method of marbling creates a cake with subtle marbleness, meaning that the vanilla and chocolate portions are more distinct in 2 different ends like a yin yang, instead of them being throughly mixed in a zebra-like pattern. It's just a matter of preference. Please see note below for a more layered marbling effect). Transfer the vanilla cake batter into the prepared pan, then using the back of a spoon, make a tunnel in the middle, around the pan. Spoon the chocolate batter into the tunnel, avoiding the sides. Using a butter knife, swirl the 2 batters together in an 'S' shape motion. Bake in the oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the center springs back to the touch and a skewer inserted down the center of the cake comes out clean or with a few moist but cooked crumbs attached.

In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine together both chocolates and heat in the microwave, stirring every 15 seconds, until almost completely melted; about 1 1/2 minutes. Remove from the microwave and stir until completely melted. Pour the hot cream on top of the chocolates and stir until completely smooth. It will look broken at the beginning but will come together just fine as you continue to stir. If you'd like, press the glaze through a fine-mesh strainer for a smoother finish.

Pour about 1 cup of batter into the center of each square traced on the parchment paper. Evenly spread it out to fit the square, leaving about ¼” border. The batter should be about 1/2” thick. Bake in preheated oven for ~{10-12%minutes}, until set and very lightly browned. Carefully transfer parchment paper to a #wire rack to cool. Once cooled, carefully remove the lady finger squares from the parchment paper, set aside to use in the recipe. Brew @coffee{1.75%cups} and let it cool. (or use instant coffee or instant espresso and brew 1 ¾ cups). Whisk the @rum{1/3%cup} (optional) into the coffee, then pour the mixture into a #large dish or #baking pan that will fit the layers. Set aside. In a #medium saucepan, whisk together @egg yolks{6}, @whole milk{1/2%cup} and @granulated sugar{1%cup} until combined. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture boils. Turn heat to medium-low and boil for ~{1%minute}, remove from heat and transfer the mixture to a #container with lid – but don’t put the lid on yet. Leave the lid open and whisk the mixture every few minutes until it’s cooled slightly. Then put the lid on and chill in the refrigerator for ~{1%hour}. NOTE: this can be done before you bake the lady fingers, if desired, so it has time to cool. It can even be done the day before and chilled overnight. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), Beat the @heavy whipping cream{1.5%cups} and @confectioners' sugar{1/4%cup} until stiff peaks form, transfer to a different bowl. In the same bowl used to beat whipping cream (but with the cream no longer in it), beat the chilled custard, @mascarpone{16%oz} and @vanilla{2%tsp} with the #paddle attachment until combined. Gently fold in beaten whipping cream. Quickly dip one of the three lady finger layers into the soaking liquid for about ~{5-10%seconds}. Do not drop it in and let it sit or it will soak up too much liquid and fall apart. Remember, homemade lady fingers are more delicate than store-bought. If using hard store-bought you will need to soak them longer. Place it in the bottom of the baking dish you used to trace the shape. Spread 1/3 of the filling mixture evenly on top of the layer. Repeat with the second and third lady finger layers and remaining custard. Alternating soaked lady finger, custard, soaked lady finger, custard. Sprinkle @unsweetened cocoa powder{1%Tbsp} over the top custard layer. Chill for at least ~{8%hours}, or overnight. Cut into square portions and serve.

Drizzle additional olive oil (about a Tablespoon) over the top of the pizza and use your pastry brush to brush the entire surface of the pizza (including the crust) with olive oil.

Add any additional flour as needed (I've found that sometimes I need as much as an additional ⅓ cup), stirring until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the bowl (see video above recipe for visual cue). The dough will still be slightly sticky but still should be manageable with your hands. Drizzle a separate, large, clean #bowl generously with @olive oil and use a #pastry brush to brush up the sides of the bowl. Lightly dust your hands with flour and form your pizza dough into a round ball and transfer to your olive oil-brushed bowl.

Allow dough to rise for ~{30%minutes} or until doubled in size. If you intend to bake this dough into a pizza, I also recommend preheating your oven to 425F (215C) at this point so that it will have reached temperature once your pizza is ready to bake. Once the dough has risen, use your hands to gently deflate it and transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth (about 3-5 times).

Tip: If you want to substitute meringue powder for the fresh egg whites, use 3 tablespoons meringue powder + 5 tablespoons water.

Tip: Baking vegan? A good substitute for the egg whites in this recipe is aquafaba, the liquid drained from a can of chickpeas. Surprisingly, it whips into peaks just like egg whites!

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, yogurt, vegetable oil, melted butter and vinegar together until smooth. Pour the egg mixture into the flour and bring everything together to form a dough. Tip out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 10 minutes, until smooth, then divide it into six pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, then place the balls on a plate or baking tray, cover them with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the syrup. Place the sugar, honey and lemon slices in a pan with 200ml of water. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes to infuse. Remove the syrup from the heat, pour into a heatproof jug, stir in the rosewater and leave to cool. Lightly dust the work surface with cornflour. Roll out one of the balls of dough to a circle about 30cm diameter. Dust the top with cornflour, then fold the right-hand edge to the centre and the left-hand edge to the centre, so that they meet. Dust again with cornflour, then fold the top down to the centre and the bottom up to the centre, to give a rough square. Dust again with cornflour. Take each corner and fold them inwards so they meet in the middle to make a smaller square. Dust again with cornflour, then repeat Step 6, folding the corners into the middle again to give an even smaller square. Turn the dough over (joins underneath), cover it and leave it to rest for 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining five balls of dough until you have six small squares. Make the filling.

data/bronze/recipes/nicholaswilde_recipes/cook/ingredients/pastry-dough/Pâte Brisée.source	Pâte Brisée		450 g all-purpose flour,2 Tbsp granulated sugar,1 tsp salt,20 Tbsp unsalted butter,152 g ice water	In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt	"In a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{450%g}, @granulated sugar{2%Tbsp}, and @salt{1%tsp}.

Add the cold @unsalted butter{20%Tbsp} to the bowl with the dry ingredients and toss, separating the pieces and coating them in the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to quickly break and smash the pieces of butter into smaller bits (it’s OK if some of the butter is left in large pieces; you’ll break it up more in the next step). Make a well in the center of the bowl and add 2/3 cup (152g) of the @ice water{152%g}. Toss with a #fork{} to distribute the water until you have a clumpy mixture with lots of dry spots.

Tip the contents of the bowl out onto a clean work surface. Use a #bench knife or bowl scraper{} to chop up the mixture, breaking up the clumps and pieces of butter and periodically using the scraper to toss and push the mixture back into a pile. Continue to chop and toss the mixture until it’s broken down into small, uniform pieces with very few floury spots and the butter pieces are no larger than a pea. This process helps bring the dough together without working it excessively, increasing tenderness.

Push the mixture into a pile and squeeze it with your hands so it holds together in large pieces. If you still have some dry floury areas, move any large pieces to one side, leaving the dry bits in the pile. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of ice water over the floury area, then use the bench knife or bowl scraper in the same chopping motion to evenly distribute the water. Squeeze the dough to bring it together, move the large pieces to the side, then repeat with more ice water as needed until no dry flour remains on the surface.

Use your hands to pat the dough firmly into a square, then use a floured rolling pin to flatten the square until it’s 3/4 inch thick. Pat around the four sides with your hands or the scraper to square off and compact the dough then cut it in half.

Lift one half up (again, using the scraper to help) and place it directly on top of the other. Use the scraper to lift the stack of dough and dust underneath with more flour, then roll over it with the #rolling pin{} to flatten and lengthen it slightly, dusting the top with flour if needed to prevent sticking. Cut the dough in half again, this time crosswise, and stack the halves again. The stacking and flattening increases the flakiness of the dough and further distributes the moisture, making it easier to roll out.

Working quickly, use the scraper to loosen the dough from the surface and dust underneath and on top with more flour, then flatten it with the rolling pin into a long rectangle measuring 3/4"" thick.

If making the Walnut & Oat Slab Pie leave the rectangle whole. If making a round pie, cut the rectangle in half crosswise to make 2 equal portions. Whatever form the dough takes when it’s chilled is the form it will most easily assume when being rolled out, so if it’s destined to be round, as for a pie, use the heel of your hand to round off any corners and press the portion(s) into more of a disk shape. If it’s destined to be rectangular, pat around the sides to straighten and square off the corners.

Wrap each piece in your favorite #reusable wrapper{}, maintaining the round or rectangular shape. Roll over the wrapped pieces with the rolling pin to flatten the dough and force it to fill out the wrap (applying this pressure will help prevent cracking later).

Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and chill until it’s very cold and firm, at least ~{2%hours}. If a recipe requires a single portion of dough, freeze the other portion and save it for another use.

To roll out the chilled pastry dough: Remove the cold pastry dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or two to soften slightly. Unwrap the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface.

Use a rolling pin to beat the dough evenly across the surface, applying enough force to leave an imprint but not enough to crack or splinter it. If rolling it into a round, beat the dough diagonally in both directions to make an X, then roll lengthwise and widthwise. Lift and rotate the dough every couple of whacks to keep the round shape. If rolling it into a square or rectangle, beat the dough lengthwise across the entire surface, then rotate it 90° (a quarter turn) and beat crosswise, repeating several times in both directions. Continue to beat the dough, lifting it frequently and adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking, until it’s just under 1/2 inch thick. This will make the dough pliable and easier to roll out while still cold.

Dust underneath and on top of the dough with more flour, then roll it out, frequently lifting and rotating the dough to work it into a round, or turning it 90° every so often and rolling it lengthwise and crosswise for a square or rectangle. Continue to roll, keeping the dough moving on the work surface and dusting it with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have the size and/or thickness specified in the recipe. If it starts to feel soft or sticky, transfer the dough to a baking sheet and freeze until it’s cold and firm, about 10 minutes, then proceed."

The dough can be used immediately or refrigerated until ready to use (1-2 days max). Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). You can also make small individual balls with the dough and roll out each individual ball to a round shape (doesn't need to be perfectly round) - if you have a tortilla press you can use it to flatten the dough balls. Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator/freezer to use later. To assemble the empanadas or turnovers, place a spoonful of the filling on the middle of each empanada disc. The amount of filling will vary based on the size of the empanada, but in general, it’s easier to seal an empanada that isn’t overstuffed. Also, the more you make empanadas, the easier it becomes to stuff them to the max and still seal them properly. To seal the empanadas, fold the disc and seal the edges by pressing the dough with your fingers. If you’re having a hard time sealing the edges, you can use brush the inside edges with egg white, it will act as a glue for the empanadas. You can also use a fork to help seal the edges, just press the top of the fork against the edges. To the repulgue or churito, the curl type seal, use your fingers to twist the curl the edges. There are also empanada molds that you can buy and will help seal the empanadas. For best results, I recommend refrigerating for at least 30 minutes the empanadas before baking – this also helps them seal better and prevents the filling from leaking out. If you want your empanadas to have a nice golden finish, then you can brush them with egg wash (a whole egg whisked or egg yolk plus a few drops of water whisked). Bake the empanadas in a pre-heated oven. I usually bake them at 375F-400F, the temperature will vary based on the oven and the size of the empanadas. I bake the smaller sized empanadas at 375F.

data/bronze/recipes/nicholaswilde_recipes/cook/ingredients/butter/Ghee.source	Ghee		2 lb unsalted butter	Take your 2 pounds of unsalted butter and put it into a large pot or saucepan. Set your stove to medium heat and allow the butter to melt completely. Once the butter has melted, increase the heat slightly until it comes to a rolling boil. Make sure to stir occasionally during this process to prevent any burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan. After reaching a rolling boil, reduce the heat slightly so that the mixture continues to simmer. The simmering butter should foam, and water will start evaporating. This process will take about 10-15 minutes. Keep an eye on the mixture and stir it occasionally. Do not leave it unattended. After 10-15 minutes, you will notice the butter developing a large amount of foam on top and you might see some brown spots - these are the milk solids starting to caramelize. Turn off the heat and let the mixture settle for about 10 minutes. The milk solids will fall to the bottom of the pan and continue to caramelize, which gives ghee its characteristic nutty flavor. After the mixture has settled, gently skim off the remaining foam from the top of the butter using a spoon or ladle. Be careful not to disturb the milk solids at the bottom. Set a sieve or strainer over a clean glass container, and line it with a cheesecloth or a clean dish towel. Slowly pour the butter into the lined strainer. Be careful not to let the browned milk solids from the bottom of the pan pour into the strainer. Only the liquid should pass through. Allow the ghee to cool down, then put the lid on your glass container. You can store ghee at room temperature for up to six months, or in the fridge for up to a year. And there you have it, your ghee is done! Your homemade ghee is now ready to use in your favorite recipes! Enjoy the nutty flavor it brings to your dishes.

Remember, unlike salted butter, ghee is, in essence, butter oil more like a cooking oil, and doesn't need added salt. You can control the salt levels in your cooking separately."	Take your @unsalted butter{2%lb} and put it into a #large pot or #saucepan. Set your stove to medium heat and allow the butter to melt completely. Once the butter has melted, increase the heat slightly until it comes to a rolling boil. Make sure to stir occasionally during this process to prevent any burning or sticking to the bottom of the pan. After reaching a rolling boil, reduce the heat slightly so that the mixture continues to simmer. The simmering butter should foam, and water will start evaporating. This process will take about ~{10-15%minutes}. Keep an eye on the mixture and stir it occasionally. Do not leave it unattended. After 10-15 minutes, you will notice the butter developing a large amount of foam on top and you might see some brown spots - these are the milk solids starting to caramelize. Turn off the heat and let the mixture settle for about ~{10%minutes}. The milk solids will fall to the bottom of the pan and continue to caramelize, which gives ghee its characteristic nutty flavor. After the mixture has settled, gently skim off the remaining foam from the top of the butter using a #spoon or #ladle. Be careful not to disturb the milk solids at the bottom.

Set the mixer bowl over the simmering water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Continuously, but gently, stir the mixture until the egg whites are very warm to the touch and the sugar has dissolved, about 4 minutes. Test this by dipping a finger into the mixture and rubbing it between your fingers—the mixture should no longer have any grains of sugar in it and should be very warm to the touch. Beat the meringue: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the meringue on medium-low speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually increase the speed and beat until you achieve a stiff peak that droops only slightly when you lift up the whisk, and the bottom and sides of the bowl no longer feel warm to the touch, about 4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and beat a few seconds to mix it in. Use your Swiss meringue: Swiss meringue is best when used immediately and served the same day.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt. In a small liquid measuring cup, whisk together the milk and the vanilla. Cream the sugar and butter, then add the eggs. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sugar and butter. Beat on medium-high until light, fluffy, and doubled in volume, 2 to 3 minutes, using a rubber spatula to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce the mixer to low and add the eggs one at a time, adding the next egg only after the previous one is fully incorporated, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the wet ingredients. With the mixer still on low, add the the dry ingredients in three equal parts, alternating with the wet ingredients in two parts. Beat until just combined, then scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl once more, then beat on low for an additional 30 seconds. Add the blueberries. Take ½ cup of the blueberries and crush them with your hands so they are juicy; add to the batter and increase the mixer speed to high for 5 to 10 seconds to encourage the berries to release their juices even more. Immediately reduce the mixer to low and add the rest of the berries, mixing until incorporated evenly throughout the batter, another 30 seconds. Rest the batter.

Meanwhile, make the filling. Halve and thinly slice @yellow onions{2 large} until you have about 5 cups. Melt the remaining @unsalted butter{4%Tbsp} in a #large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until jammy and dark brown (similar in color to mahogany), ~{20-25%minutes}. This process will take time; don’t rush it. If the bottom of the pan starts to burn before the onions caramelize, add 1 @water{1%Tbsp} to the pan and scrape the bottom. Repeat this as many times as necessary to prevent burning. Meanwhile, prepare the @Brussels sprouts{8%oz} and @Swiss cheese{8%oz}. Trim the root end from the Brussels sprouts and thinly slice into ribbony rounds (about 2 1/2 cups). If needed, grate the Swiss cheese on the large holes of a box grater (about 2 cups). When the onions are ready, add the Brussels sprouts, @Worcestershire sauce or balsamic vinegar{1%tsp}, @kosher salt{0.5%tsp}, and @black pepper{0.5%tsp} to the pan. Cook, stirring often, until the Brussels sprouts are tender, lightly browned in spots, and wilt, ~{5-7%minutes}. (If the bottom of the pan starts to burn, continue adding water 1 tablespoon at a time as needed.) Transfer the mixture to a #large bowl and let cool until warm but no longer hot, about ~{10%minutes}. Meanwhile, wash and dry the pan used to cook the onions. Add the cheese to the onion mixture and toss to combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Heat the same pan over medium-low heat. Meanwhile, assemble the sandwiches: Spread one side of @rye bread{8 slices} with the softened butter (about 1/2 tablespoon per slice). Flip 4 of the slices over; spread @Dijon mustard{1%Tbsp} on each of these slices. Divide the Brussels sprouts mixture onto the mustard slices and arrange into an even layer all the way to the edge. Close the sandwiches with the remaining bread slices buttered-side up. Add 2 of the sandwiches to the pan and cook until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is completely melted, ~{4-5%minutes} per side. Transfer to a clean cutting board and repeat cooking the remaining 2 sandwiches. Cut each sandwich in half.

Pour the mixture over the warm milk, whisking continuously, then pour into a clean, heavy-based pan and cook over a very low heat. Simmer the mixture gently for 3–4 minutes, stirring continuously, until smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, cover the surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming, then leave to cool. For the meringue. Heat the oven to 150°C/130°C fan/300°F/Gas 2. In a stand mixer, whisk the egg whites, salt, cream of tartar and 25g of the caster sugar on medium speed for 5 minutes. Increase the speed to high and add the remaining 50g sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking continuously to a soft glossy meringue. Whisk in the vanilla paste. Spoon the meringue into the piping bag and snip the bag 2cm from the pointed end. Pipe the meringue into the moulds and level with a palette knife. Place the mould on a rack set in a roasting tin. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting tin to come just over the level of the rack. Do not let the water touch the silicon mould. Transfer to the oven and bake for 9–10 minutes, until set.

Carefully butter and flour a 16-cup Bundt pan, making sure to get in all of the cracks and crevices. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar until combined. Add lemon zest, and then cream the mixture until light and fluffy on medium-high speed, about 5 minutes. With the mixer on low, add the eggs one at a time, making sure each egg is completely incorporated before adding the next. Add the yogurt, lemon juice and vanilla, and stir on medium speed to combine, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary to incorporate all the ingredients. The mixture may curdle a bit, but don’t worry too much about it. Add the flour mixture all at once and mix on low until almost completely combined. Remove the bowl from the mixer, scrape and fold any excess flour into the batter, and scoop out roughly 1/2 cup/100 grams of batter. Drop tablespoons of batter into the bottom of the prepared pan, and smooth into the bottom of the pan. (This batter will prevent the strawberries from sinking to the bottom of the pan and sticking.) Add the chopped strawberries to the remaining batter in the bowl and gently fold in until the strawberries are evenly distributed. The batter will be thick. Spoon the batter evenly into the pan, smooth the top and tap the pan firmly on the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles. Bake the cake until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean (a few small crumbs are O.K.), about 70 minutes. Cool the pan on a rack for 15 minutes, then turn the cake out onto the rack to cool completely. When the cake is cool, make the glaze: In a medium bowl, use a fork to mash the reserved 1/4 cup/40 grams of strawberries. Whisk in the confectioners' sugar and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. The glaze should be thick but just pourable. If it seems thin, add a bit more confectioners' sugar; if it is too thick to stir, add a bit more lemon juice. Pour the glaze evenly over the cake (you can glaze it over a rack if you prefer to let the excess glaze drip off), let it set for a few minutes and serve.

If testing with a toothpick, the toothpick should come out dirty for fudge-textured brownies. After ~{15-20%minutes}, carefully remove them out of the pan and allow to cool to room temperature before slicing into 16 brownies. They set while they cool. ENJOY! Crushed walnuts, peanuts, almonds, pecans, etc. Chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, shredded coconut, dried fruit (cranberries, raisins, etc) Store at room temperature for 3 days, or refrigerator for up to 5 days. These brownies can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before serving OR reheat in the microwave.

Add onion wedges, water, tomatoes with their juices, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally and add additional salt as needed.

Stand each lemon up on one end, and use a sharp paring knife to follow the curve of the fruit and cut the peel and white pith away; discard it. Chop the lemon flesh into small pieces and remove the seeds and any large pieces of membrane. Transfer the chopped lemons to a bowl if the juice is running off of the board. (You should have about ⅓ cup.) Set aside. Add the granulated sugar to the bowl with the zest and rub the mixture together with your fingers to release the oils in the zest.

add in a splash of white wine also for a gourmet feel! (i usually add in 3-4 tablespoons)
fresh parsley is the only way to go with this! i don't really recommend cooking or garnishing with dried parsley

In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter, in a few additions, and beat until combined. Stop to scrape the sides and the bottom of the bowl a few times. After that, add the milk and vanilla and mix to combine. Remove the dough from the mixer and separate it into two equal halves. Press each half into a disk and wrap it in plastic wrap. Chill in the fridge for about an hour. Lightly flour a flat surface and once the dough has chilled, roll it out on the floured surface into a ⅛"" thick circle. Using a doughnut cutter, cut out as many cookies as possible. Also, you can use a larger and a smaller glass, to cut the cookies and also the hole in the center. Arrange the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper 1-inch apart. Bake for 10 - 15 minutes or until they are pale golden brown. Transfer the cookies onto a wire rack to cool completely before adding the topping. In the meantime, spread the coconut onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake it for 10 - 15 minutes at 350 degrees F until toasted, stirring frequently. Once done, remove from the oven to cool. Melt the caramels and milk in a double boiler over medium-low heat and stir until melted. Remove from heat, and in a large bowl combine half of the melted caramel with the toasted coconut.

Preheat oven to 325°F/163°C. Line a large 17 x 12 inch (43 x 30 cm) baking or cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat. To peel the almonds: Over high heat, bring a saucepan of water to a boil.Add the almonds and boil for 1 minute (no longer because they will soften). Drain and rinse with cold water to cool and stop them from cooking. Spread onto a towel and rub them until the peels come off. Dry well. Add the almonds to a food processor or blender and pulse until finely chopped. In a mixing bowl, stir together the almonds, flour and orange peel. To a small saucepan add the sugar, heavy cream corn syrup and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the mixture comes to a rolling boil and the sugar is completely dissolved. Continue to simmer for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and add the mixture to the almond mix along with the vanilla. Stir until combined. Allow to cool until it is cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. Using a teaspoon measuring spoon, portion out 1 teaspoon of dough and roll into a ball using your hands. Roll the balls as round as you can, this will ensure nice round cookies. If the dough seems dry and crumbly, simply put a ball of the dough your warm hand it will soften so you can shape. Place the dough balls 6-inches (15 cm) apart  on to the prepared baking sheet. They spread to 3-inches (7 ½ cm) in diameter. You'll need to work in batches to fit your baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. If they join together, use a sharp knife to separate while they are hot and soft on the baking sheet as they will harden very quickly. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes until they are no longer soft, then transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining dough. In a microwave safe bowl, add the chocolate and microwave in 10 second increments, stirring in between until melted. Be careful not to burn. Take a cooled cookie, spread the chocolate on one side, take another cookie and make a sandwich, press carefully as they are delicate. Repeat with all cookies. If you would like to drizzle chocolate on the top, put the melted chocolate into a small ziptop bag. Snip of a very tiny piece of the corner and this will allow you to get the perfect drizzle.

Remove from the heat and add the mixture to the almond mix along with the @vanilla{1/2%tsp}. Stir until combined. Allow to cool until it is cool enough to handle, about ~{15%minutes}.

Using a teaspoon measuring spoon, portion out 1 teaspoon of dough and roll into a ball using your hands. Roll the balls as round as you can, this will ensure nice round cookies. If the dough seems dry and crumbly, simply put a ball of the dough your warm hand it will soften so you can shape.

Place the dough balls 6 inches (15 cm) apart on to the prepared baking sheet. They spread to 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter. You'll need to work in batches to fit your baking sheet.

Bake for 10 to ~{12%minutes} or until golden brown. If they join together, use a #sharp knife{} to separate while they are hot and soft on the baking sheet as they will harden very quickly.

Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for ~{2%minutes} until they are no longer soft, then transfer to a #cooling rack{}. Repeat with the remaining dough.

In a microwave safe bowl, add the @milk or dark chocolate{567%g} and microwave in 10 second increments, stirring in between until melted. Be careful not to burn.

Take a cooled cookie, spread the chocolate on one side, take another cookie and make a sandwich, press carefully as they are delicate. Repeat with all cookies.

If you would like to drizzle chocolate on the top, put the melted chocolate into a small zip top bag. Snip of a very tiny piece of the corner and this will allow you to get the perfect drizzle.

Without chilling, the piped cookies will over-spread. If you chill the dough prior to shaping, the dough will be too cold/stiff to pipe. Line 2–3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2–2.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above. Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1–2-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it’s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1–2-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar. Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Bake the chilled cookies for 12–15 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes.

Make sure you only brown the butter lightly. When butter browns the liquid evaporates off which can dry out your dough. As soon as the butter starts to turn brown and smell nutty, take it off the heat to prevent any more liquid from escaping. Take butter off the heat and allow to cool for about a minute, or until no longer hot to the touch, before using. Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper In a large mixing bowl combine the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat until mixed together. Add in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Mix well. Add the flour, salt and baking soda and beat until well mixed. Add the oats and mix until just combined and no streaks of flour remain. Use a 1.5 ounce cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough out into balls, placing them 2 inches apart on the prepared sheet. Bake for 12 minutes, or until the edges are just golden brown and the centers have puffed up but are still gooey. Transfer the cookies to a cooling rack to cool.

Brown the Butter - Cut the butter into 14 even-sized pieces. In a medium skillet, melt 10 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until golden brown and a nutty aroma forms, 1 to 3 minutes.Remove the skillet from heat. Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter into warm butter until completely melted. Mix the Butter and Sugars– In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the browned butter to the mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla. Whisk on medium speed (setting 5) until combined, 30 seconds. Whisk and Rest– Add the whole egg and yolk to the mixing bowl. Whisk on medium-high speed (setting 8) until smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let the mixture stand for 3 minutes.Repeat the whisking and resting process 3 more times: 30 seconds mixing at medium-high speed and 3 minutes of rest. After four total times, the mixture should be thick, smooth, and shiny. Add the Flour and M&M's - Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in ¾ cup M&M candies and chocolate chips. Give the dough a final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain. Chill the Dough - Transfer the mixing bowl to the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer for 15 minutes. Chill until the dough firms up, around 65 to 70ºF (18 to 21ºC). The dough should not feel overly sticky. Preheat the Oven - Adjust the oven rack to the middle position. Heat to 375°F (191ºC). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, then set aside. Roll Out Dough Balls– Divide the dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (about 60 grams, 2 ounces), and roll into a ball. If the dough starts to warm and get sticky, place it on a sheet tray and refrigerate for 15 minutes.For a rustic appearance, tear the dough balls in half, then press the two halves together again with the lumpy torn sides facing upward to expose the chips. Shape the sides of the dough back into a circle. If desired, use the remaining ¼ cup of M&M candies and press some on top, so they pop out of the surface.Arrange dough balls at least 2"" apart on lined baking sheets, 8 portions per tray. Smaller baking sheets can be used but will require baking in 3 batches. The dough should be room temperature or just below for even cooking, around 65 to 70ºF (18 to 21ºC). Bake the Cookies - Bake one tray at a time in the center position for 5 minutes, then rotate the baking sheet. Continue to bake until the edges are golden brown and the centers look slightly underdone, about 5 to 7 minutes. The color will continue to darken during cooling.

Since we knew that the starch granules in flour mute the flavor of peanut butter we briefly turned our attention to an Internet sensation flourless peanut butter cookies made with just peanut butter sugar egg and sometimes a bit of baking soda. Indeed when we tried a sample batch of our cookies sans flour they tasted super peanut-y and baked up looking much like traditional peanut butter cookies. Why didnt these flourless cookies melt right off of the cookie sheet Because peanut butter contains approximately  percent carbohydrates and  percent protein components that absorb moisture and harden into a stable network in the heat of the oven. But without the sturdier structure that only starch from wheat flour can provide these cookies fell apart in our hands before we could even take a bite.  Many recipes for peanut butter sandwich cookies disappoint with soft dull-tasting cookies and overly sweet fillings.

Using a #flexible spatula, stir in melted @butter{2%Tbsp} and season with salt and @pepper to taste. Add @choux pastry{0.5 recipe}, and stir until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing plastic against surface of the potato-choux mixture to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside (mixture can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours, or refrigerated for up to 8 hours and brought to room temperature before frying). Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 200°F (95°C). Set a #wire rack inside a #rimmed baking sheet and line rack with #paper towels. In a #large Dutch oven, heat @vegetable oil{2%qt} over medium-high heat to 340°F (171°C). Using a 1-tablespoon #cookie scoop, scoop dough and carefully add to hot oil, dropping portion from as close to the oil’s surface as possible to minimize splashing. (Alternatively, using a #spoon, scoop roughly 1-tablespoon of dough, and using a second spoon, gently form into a rough, oblong shape, then carefully add to hot oil). Working quickly, repeat process with 9 more portions of dough (for a batch of 10). Fry, using a #spider or #slotted spoon to turn pieces as they cook, until puffed and golden brown on all sides, about 3 1/2 minutes. Transfer pommes dauphine to prepared wire rack, season with salt, and transfer to oven to keep warm. Return oil to 340°F (171°C) and repeat frying with remaining dough, continuing to work in batches of 10. Transfer pommes dauphine to a #serving bowl and serve immediately.

Cut 25g of the butter into cubes, add these to the bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the caster sugar, yeast and salt and stir to combine.  Beat the milk, warm water and egg together in a separate bowl and pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon to bring the ingredients together, then turn out the mixture onto the work surface and knead it with a dough scraper for 5 minutes, until you have a slightly sticky dough. Wrap the dough and chill it for 1 hour.  Place the remaining block of chilled butter between 2 sheets of baking paper and flatten it out with a rolling pin to a rectangle measuring about 33 x 19cm.  Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the chilled dough to a rectangle about 1cm thick and measuring 50 x 20cm. With a short end of the dough closest to you, lay the butter on top of the dough, so that it covers the bottom two thirds. Make sure that it is positioned neatly and almost reaches the sides.  Fold the exposed dough at the top (without the butter) down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom third of the dough (with butter) up over the dough – you will now have a sandwich of 2 layers of butter and 3 layers of dough. Pinch together the edges of the dough lightly to seal in the butter and turn the dough/butter parcel 90 degrees, so the long seam is on the left-hand side. Wrap the dough and chill it for 20 minutes to harden the butter.  With the seam still on the left, roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle, about 1cm thick and 50 x 20cm, as before. With a short end of the dough closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top. Put the dough back in the fridge for 20 minutes.  <strong>Make the crème pâtissière.</strong> While the dough is in the fridge, in a medium bowl and using a balloon whisk, whisk the caster sugar with the egg yolks, cornflour and 1 tablespoon of the milk until pale and combined.  Gently heat the remaining milk with the vanilla seeds in a small saucepan until it just comes to the boil. Pour the hot milk into the egg mixture and whisk until well combined. Return the mixture to the pan and heat it gently, whisking continuously, until the mixture thickens to a custard consistency. Pour the crème pâtissière into a bowl, cover the surface and leave it to cool. Then, chill it until set.  <strong>Finish the pain aux raisins.</strong> Remove the dough from the freezer, unwrap it and roll it out on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle about 1cm thick and 50 x 20cm, as before. With one of the short edges closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top. Roll out the dough to a 30cm square.  Spread the crème pâtissière over the dough, leaving a 2cm border on the side furthest from you.  Sprinkle the raisins, cinnamon and orange zest over the crème pâtissière, then starting from the edge furthest from you, roll the dough towards you into a spiralled sausage shape, keeping it as tight as possible – give the dough a gentle tug each time you roll to tighten it up and give it a little tension. When you reach the end, roll the sausage back and forth a few times to seal the join.  Cut the roll into 12 equal slices, each about 2.5–3cm wide. Lay the slices, cut-side up and spaced apart to allow for rising, on the lined baking trays. Put each tray inside a proving bag and leave the dough to prove for 1 hour, until it has at least doubled in size.  Heat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C fan/425°F/Gas 7. Brush the risen dough with beaten egg and bake the pains for 15–20 minutes, until golden brown and risen.

Use a sturdy spoon, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough	"Stir together 540 g to 600 g @bread flour{540%g}, @granulated sugar{1%Tbsp}, @instant yeast{2.25%tsp}, @salt{2.5%tsp}, and @lukewarm (90-110°F) water{379%g} in a #large bowl{}, starting with 540 g of the flour. Use a #sturdy spoon{}, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough.

If you’re kneading the dough by hand, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, using some of the additional 1/2 cup of flour called for. Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you, then press it away from you with the heels of your hands. Rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this fold-press-rotate process with a rhythmic, rocking motion for about ~{6%minutes}. When fully kneaded, the dough will be bouncy and smooth.

If you’re using your stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough at medium speed for about 7 minutes, until it’s smooth, elastic, and feels a bit bouncy. If the dough doesn’t form a ball that clears the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in just enough of the additional flour to make this happen.

Place the dough in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with @vegetable oil or cooking spray{}; the bowl you started with is fine. Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} or another airtight cover, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it's doubled in size, about 1 to ~{2%hours}. If your kitchen is particularly cold (below 65°F), place the bowl of dough in your turned-off oven with the oven light on.

Gently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6” x 8” oval.

Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.

Place the loaves, seam-side down, on a #baking sheet{} (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with @cornmeal{}; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.

Let the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for ~{45%minutes}. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.

For extra-crusty crust and a great rise, add steam to your oven as follows: While the oven is preheating, place an empty #cast-iron frying pan{} on the lowest rack. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in the microwave or on the stovetop.

When your bread is risen, use a #sieve{} to dust the loaves with a thin coat of flour. Then make three or four 1/2” deep diagonal slashes in each loaf; these slashes will help the bread rise evenly as it bakes. Place the bread in the oven and pour the boiling water into the frying pan below. Quickly shut the oven door. Wear good oven mitts during this process to shield your hands and arms from the steam.

Bake the bread for 20 to ~{25%minutes}, until the crust is golden brown and a loaf sounds hollow to the touch when you tap it on the bottom. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer.

Turn the oven off, crack the door open, and allow the bread to remain inside for an additional ~{5%minutes}; this helps keep the crust crisp. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack. It’s best not to cut into the bread until it’s cooled down a bit; cutting into hot bread can negatively affect its texture.

Store the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days. Freeze for longer storage."	Weigh your @bread flour{540%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

That lent a distinctive deep, molasses-y flavor that some of our tasters didn’t like. The test kitchen’s favorite cornmeal is Anson Mills Fine Yellow Cornmeal. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Grease 8-inch square baking pan. Whisk buttermilk, honey, eggs, and melted butter in bowl until thoroughly combined and no streaks of honey remain. Whisk flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in large bowl.

In a large bowl, combine the starter ingredients	"Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a #large bowl{}, combine the starter ingredients.

To make the starter: Mix @water{113%g}, @instant yeast{1/16%tsp}, and @all-purpose flour{120%g} together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become bubbly.

To make the dough: Mix and knead @water{255%g}, starter, @instant yeast{1.5%tsp}, @all-purpose flour{420%g}, and @salt{2%tsp} together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.

Place the dough in a lightly greased #medium-sized bowl{}, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for ~{45%minutes}. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three equal pieces.

Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to ~{1%hour}, if that works better with your schedule.

Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.

Turn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.

With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16"" log. Your goal is a 15"" baguette, so 16"" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical ""pointy"" end.

Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy (""marshmallow-y"" is the term we use in our baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68°F).

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a #cast iron pan{} on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.

If your baguettes have risen in a #dish towel or couche{}, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece of #parchment{}, seam-side down. If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment (seam-side down) and then place the parchment on a baking sheet.

Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.

Load the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust.

Bake the baguettes - on the pan, or on a stone - for 24 to ~{28%minutes}, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2"", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.

Storage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage. Thaw and reheat just before serving."	No Cooklang format found.

The next day, drain the soaked chickpeas and place them in a saucepan, cover with fresh water, add a bay leaf and simmer for a couple of hours or until the chickpeas are soft. Add salt to taste at the end. Don’t throw away the cooking liquid – this is gold and you’ll need it for the sauce. If using canned chickpeas, skip to next step. In another saucepan, gently heat a smashed garlic clove, a sprig of rosemary (minus the twigs, or remove them before adding the chickpeas) and the chilli in a few tablespoons of olive oil. When the garlic begins to get fragrant and soften, perhaps even slightly colour, add the tomato and let sizzle for a few minutes. Add a ladle-full of the chickpea liquid (if you’ve used canned, use the liquid in the can) and about two-thirds of the chickpeas. Puree the remaining chickpeas before adding to the saucepan to create a creamy, thick sauce. There are some who remove the lump of smashed garlic before adding the chickpea puree – but I leave it in. Add more of the chickpea liquid (or water or stock) to the sauce until it is quite watery, then add the pasta and cook until the al dente and the sauce has reduced. If you choose to use a long pasta, you may want to cook it separately in a pot of water then simply add it to the ready sauce. By the time the pasta has cooked, the sauce should be creamy, not watery, but not too thick either. Like a creamy soup. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper. Ladle into shallow bowls, pour over your very best extra virgin olive oil, more freshly ground pepper and then let it sit for a moment or two before serving as it will be piping hot and it needs to cool a little to be best enjoyed. Grated Parmesan or Pecorino cheese is entirely optional.

Add a ladle-full of the chickpea liquid (if you’ve used canned, use the liquid in the can) and about two-thirds of the chickpeas.

If you choose to use a long pasta, you may want to cook it separately in a pot of water then simply add it to the ready sauce.

By the time the pasta has cooked, the sauce should be creamy, not watery, but not too thick either. Like a creamy soup. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper. Ladle into shallow bowls, pour over your very best extra virgin olive oil, more freshly ground pepper and then let it sit for a moment or two before serving as it will be piping hot and it needs to cool a little to be best enjoyed.

Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Stir in the cream, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, egg yolks, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Editor's Tip: Be sure to choose a saucepan that will fit the sauce and the cooked fettuccine. Everything will be combined in the pan before serving. If you prefer a garlicky Alfredo sauce, feel free to add minced garlic or garlic powder in this step. Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F. Do not boil the sauce. Editor's Tip: An instant-read meat thermometer is useful for making Alfredo sauce with eggs. Monitoring the temperature is the best way to ensure the egg yolks won't get hot enough to scramble. Drain the fettuccine and add it to the saucepan with the Alfredo sauce and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. If you'd like, sprinkle parsley over the fettuccine Alfredo. Editor's Tip: After stirring the pasta, sauce and cheese, the thick sauce and cheese should cling to the pasta. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, let the pasta simmer in the sauce for a few minutes before serving	"To start, cook the @fettuccine{4%oz} according to the package instructions.

Pour the cup of @heavy whipping cream{1%cup} into the pot, stirring to combine. While heavy whipping cream and heavy cream are typically used interchangeably for some cooks, they do contain a slight difference in milk fat content, so the consistency might be a bit different if you decide to substitute.

Once combined, sprinkle in 1/4 cup @Parmesan{1/4%cup} cheese, all the @Romano cheese{1/4%cup}, the lightly beaten @egg yolk{1}, @salt{1/8%tsp}, @pepper{1%dash} and @nutmeg{1%dash}. The extra dash of ground nutmeg elevates the flavor along with the usual salt and pepper combo, making the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce stand out among the rest.

Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F; do not bring to a boil.

Drain the cooked fettuccine pasta, then add it to the saucepan with the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce and the remaining Parmesan cheese. Stir together the pasta, sauce and cheese until fully combined. The thick sauce and extra cheese should cling to the pasta nicely. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, you can let the pasta simmer for a few minutes to thicken it up before serving.

Place a heavy rimmed baking sheet upside-down on the rack, and heat the oven to 450°F.  Make the sauce: Place the garlic in a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and pulse until coarsely chopped, 2 to 3 pulses. Add the tomatoes and their juices, olive oil, sugar, vinegar, salt, and pepper and process until puréed or to desired consistency, 20 to 30 seconds; set aside. Divide the pizza dough into two pieces. If the dough is sticky, dust with a little bit of all-purpose flour. Dust a 12-inch piece of parchment paper with cornmeal and place the dough on it. Use the heel of your hand to press the dough flat. Work from the middle out to shape it into a 10-inch round with your hands or a rolling pin. The dough will stick to the parchment; if it starts to shrink back, wait a few minutes to let it relax and continue shaping. Brush the dough with 1 teaspoon of the olive oil, then spread 1/4 cup of the sauce into a thin layer onto dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Carefully remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven and use the parchment paper to slide the pizza onto the back of the baking sheet.  Bake for 4 minutes. Top the pizza with half of the mozzarella, leaving some space between the slices. Bake until the crust is golden brown and crisp and the cheese melts, 6 to 7 minutes more.

Our tomato-butter sauce isn't strictly canonical; if you'd prefer a more traditional accompaniment, substitute our   Simple Tomato Sauce   or browned butter and fresh sage. Serve with a simple salad. FOR THE GNUDI: Line rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. Spread ricotta in even layer over towels; set aside and let sit for 10 minutes. Place flour, Parmesan, panko, salt, pepper, and lemon zest in large bowl and stir to combine. Process spinach in food processor until finely chopped, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer spinach to bowl with flour mixture. Grasp paper towels and fold ricotta in half; peel back towels. Rotate sheet 90 degrees and repeat folding and peeling 2 more times to consolidate ricotta into smaller mass. Using paper towels as sling, transfer ricotta to bowl with spinach mixture. Discard paper towels but do not wash sheet. Add egg whites to bowl and mix gently until well combined. Transfer heaping teaspoons of dough to now-empty sheet (you should have 45 to 50 portions). Using your dry hands, gently roll each portion into 1-inch ball. FOR THE SAUCE: Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, swirling saucepan occasionally, until butter is very foamy and garlic is pale golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, add tomatoes and vinegar; cover and set aside. Bring 1 quart water to boil in Dutch oven. Add 1½ teaspoons salt. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer all gnudi to water. Return water to gentle simmer. Cook, adjusting heat to maintain gentle simmer, for 5 minutes, starting timer once water has returned to simmer (to confirm doneness, cut 1 dumpling in half; center should be firm).

Set potatoes either on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, on a baking sheet lined with a layer of salt, or directly on the oven's racks. Bake until completely tender throughout when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a work surface. Using tongs to hold hot potatoes, slice each in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop potato flesh into a ricer or food mill fitted with the finest disk. Press potato flesh onto a clean work surface, spreading it into an even layer, and allow steam to escape for a few minutes. Drizzle egg yolks all over, if using. Scoop 1/2 cup flour into a fine-mesh sieve and tap to dust flour all over potatoes. Using a pastry blender or bench scraper, chop down repeatedly all over to cut flour and egg into potato. Using a bench scraper, gather up shaggy potato mass and pat into a loose ball. Press ball flat with hands, then fold in half using bench scraper and press down again. Scoop remaining 1/4 cup flour into sieve and dust all over potato dough. Continue to gently fold and press, just until a uniform dough comes together. (Make sure to simply fold and press down; avoid the smearing motion more commonly used when kneading bread.) Dust potato dough all over with flour and gently form into a log. Clean work area well and dust with fresh flour. Using bench scraper, slice off a roughly 1-inch-thick portion of dough and roll into a snake about 1/2 inch thick; use a light touch as you roll, trying to use your palms more than your fingers, and dusting as necessary with flour to prevent sticking. Using bench scraper, cut snake into 1-inch portions, trimming off uneven ends as necessary. Transfer gnocchi to a well-floured area or baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough. Bring a large pot of very well-salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it foams. Add sage and fry until very aromatic and butter begins to lightly brown; remove from heat. Using a bench scraper or slotted spatula to scoop them up, transfer gnocchi to boiling water.

Gently heat cream: In a medium saucepan, combine cream and half the sugar (1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons). Scrape vanilla bean seeds into pan, then add pod. Heat over medium just until mixture starts to bubble around the edge of the pan, 7 to 8 minutes (do not let boil). Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks with remaining sugar and the salt. Temper eggs: Use ladle to pour a small amount of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture, then whisk to combine. (This is called tempering and prevents the eggs from curdling.) Add two more ladles of cream mixture, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition. Gradually whisk in remaining cream mixture. Strain through a fine sieve into a large liquid measuring cup (to remove the vanilla pod and any cooked bits of egg). Bake: Divide custard evenly among baking dishes. Place pan in oven. Add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake until custards are just set (they should tremble slightly in center when shaken), 30 to 40 minutes. Chill: Remove pan from oven. Use tongs to carefully remove dishes from hot-water bath and place on a wire rack for 30 minutes. Then, cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours (or up to 3 days) before serving. The custard will finish setting in the refrigerator. If you like, transfer the custards to the freezer 15 minutes before serving to ensure they stay cold after being bruleed (this is especially important if using the broiler). Caramelize tops and serve: Sprinkle about 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar over each custard.

Begin to melt @unsalted butter{6%Tbsp} over low heat in a #medium or large saucepan{}.

Add the @marshmallows{16%oz} to the saucepan and stir.

Continue to stir often, until about 75 percent of the marshmallows are melted.

Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir, smashing the marshmallows using a #rubber spatula{} or the back of a wooden spoon, until the marshmallows completely melt and become smooth.

Note: We recommend taking the marshmallows off the heat before they are completely melted, so you will not overheat the marshmallows. The residual heat from the melted marshmallows will heat the unmelted marshmallows slowly, allowing them to melt without getting too hot. When marshmallows are overheated, the sugar crystallizes, turning into hard candy. Overheated marshmallows will make your treats hard to bite into.

Pour the marshmallows over the cereal and toss to combine.

Note: We recommend pouring the marshmallows over the cereal instead of adding them to the pan. If the cereal is poured into the hot pan, the crisp rice may become soft if it gets too hot. Your treats may taste stale immediately after they are made because the cereal will be soft.

Once the cereal is mixed with the melted marshmallows, pour it into a well-buttered 9 x 13 pan.

GENTLY spread it into an even layer. Do not compress the mixture or your treats will be dense and hard.

Allow the treats to cool for at least ~{30%minutes} before cutting into rectangles or squares.

Notes

European-style salted butter contains more butterfat than American-style butter adding richness to the treats. Salted butter balances out the sweetness.

We recommend using Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallows. They have great texture and flavor. We found store-brand marshmallows to be stickier. If you use store-brand marshmallows, we recommend adding up to one additional cup of Rice Krispies Cereal.

Store your treats in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

Do NOT refrigerate your treats. They will become stale-tasting if stored in the fridge.

You can freeze the treats. Wrap them well, and freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, bring them to room temperature and let them sit, wrapped, for a few hours. Then unwrap and enjoy.

Do NOT overheat your marshmallows. This is key to making soft and chewy Rice Krispie Treats, not hard treats.

Do NOT compact the cereal treat mixture into your pan or you will end up with very dense, hard treats. Gently press the mixture into the pan."

Shake the pan and stir the buttery sauce until it separates and the sugar caramelises to a toffee colour. Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for ~{10-12%minutes}, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelised. Don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelise them as much as possible. Splash in the @brandy{2%Tbsp} and let it flambé, then set the pears aside. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roll the @all-butter puff pastry{500%g} out to the thickness of a £1 coin. Using a plate slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out. When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the centre, with the cardamom pods scattered around. Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon’s guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for ~{15%minutes}.

Rub in the chilled butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add enough cold water to form a dough (about 6 tablespoons). On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle (approx. 15cm x 40cm).  Scatter half of the frozen butter over the bottom two-thirds of the dough. Fold down the top third and fold up the bottom third as if folding a letter. Turn the folded dough by 90 degrees and roll it out into a rectangle again. Repeat the process of adding the remaining frozen butter and fold as before.  Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes before using. For the crème pâtissière, pour the milk and cream into a pan. Add the vanilla paste and bring just to the boil, then take off the heat.  Whisk the egg yolks, caster sugar and cornflour together in a bowl. Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture whisking continuously.  Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously until the cream thickens. Cook over a low heat for 2 - 3 minutes to cook out the flour.

If the candy stiffens before you’re done scooping, add a spoonful of @boiling hot water{0.25%cup} and stir until it loosens, then continue scooping until you have formed all the pralines. Allow the candy to fully set at room temperature; it should take about ~{30%minutes} for the pralines to harden. Store the pralines in an airtight container at room temperature. Enjoy

Make sure to use milk chocolate in bar form, not chocolate chips. If you do not have a mini-muffin tin, you can use a regular 12-cup muffin tin to make 12 larger peanut butter cups. Line 24‑cup mini-muffin tin with 24 paper liners. Place chocolate in large zipper-lock plastic bag and seal, removing as much air as possible from bag. Use rolling pin to gently pound chocolate into small pieces. In small microwave-safe bowl, add half of pounded chocolate. Heat in microwave at 50 percent power for 1 minute. Use rubber spatula to stir chocolate. Return to microwave and heat at 50 percent power until melted, about 1 minute longer. Use oven mitts to remove bowl from microwave. Use rubber spatula to stir chocolate until completely melted and smooth. Pour melted chocolate into one quart-size zipper-lock bag. Push chocolate to one corner of bag and twist top. Use scissors to snip ⅛ inch off corner of filled bag. Pipe chocolate in spiral in each muffin-tin cup, working from outside in, to cover bottom of liner (see photo 1, “Step-by-Step: How to Pipe Peanut Butter Cups,” below). Transfer muffin tin to freezer and freeze for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, add peanut butter to second small microwave-safe bowl and heat in microwave until warm, about 1 minute. Use oven mitts to remove bowl from microwave. Add confectioners’ sugar, butter, and salt to warmed peanut butter and use clean rubber spatula to stir until well combined. Fill second quart-size zipper-lock bag with peanut butter mixture. Use scissors to snip ⅛ inch off corner of filled bag. Remove muffin tin from freezer. Pipe peanut butter mixture over chocolate layer in each muffin-tin cup in spiral to cover chocolate layer (see photo 2, “Step-by-Step: How to Pipe Peanut Butter Cups,” below). Add remaining pounded chocolate to bowl used to melt chocolate. Heat in microwave at 50 percent power for 1 minute. Use rubber spatula to stir chocolate. Return to microwave and heat at 50 percent power until melted, about 1 minute longer. Use oven mitts to remove bowl from microwave.

Baking with milk chocolate chips is very convenient no chopping or little bits of chocolate to clean up or ahem eat but sometimes they wont act in the same way as a milk chocolate bar. Confusing we know. Our favorite milk chocolate chips while delicious contain stabilizers. That means that when they melt they turn gloppy and thick rather than creamy and smooth.

You want to have a soft, not sticky dough. Knead extremely lightly to bring together and then wrap in cling film and freeze for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, line two baking trays with greaseproof. Once the dough has chilled, flour the surface and roll out the dough with sharp taps up and down the dough, rather than rolling, flouring the surface more if necessary. Continue to tap the dough up and down until it measures 30cm by 10cm.  Brush off any excess flour and fold the bottom third up and the top third down and turn so the dough looks like a closed book. Roll out again to the same size and repeat the fold before freezing again for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, start making the crème diplomat by making a crème patisserie. Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and flours until well combined and then heat the milk until just before simmering. Add 5 tbsp of milk to the egg mixture and whisk together to combine.

You can follow my recipe for an all butter flaky pie crust, use your favorite recipe, or a store-bought crust. To make the tart cherry pie filling: add frozen tart cherries, sugar, cornstarch, flour and almond extract to a large pot and place over medium heat. After 5 minutes or so, the cherries will thaw, begin to break down and the sugar will melt. Stir frequently during this time. Add in butter and amaretto and continue to stir. After another 5-10 or so minutes, the mixture will begin to thicken and start to bubble along the edges. Once the filling begins to stick slightly to the back of your spoon, remove it from the heat and set aside to cool off. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. While your oven preheats, make the dutch crumble topping: in a medium bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar and oats. Add in the melted butter and stir together with a fork until it begins to form into crumbles and resembles clumpy wet sand. You may need to use your hands/fingers to form into nice crumbles. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 5 minutes or until ready to use. Remove pie pan with pie crust from the refrigerator and place pie pan onto a large baking sheet. I do this to avoid any spillage that may happen as the pie filling bubbles and bakes. Pour cooled tart cherry pie filling into the crust, then top filling with the dutch crumble topping. Bake for 1 hour-1 hour 15 minutes or until the filling is very bubbly and the crumble is slightly golden brown. Check pie after 30 minutes to make sure the crust isn’t burning. If it is getting too golden brown, simply cover pie edges with foil or pie shield. Allow pie to cool on a wire rack until completely cooled before cutting into it (this is annoying, but if you cut into it before then the pie filling won't be set). The longer the pie rests, the easier it is to serve! Can be made a few days ahead of time. Pie is best served at room temp or just slightly warm. Serves 9. Great with vanilla bean ice cream. Enjoy!

Form the dough into a disk and wrap it with plastic wrap.  Chill the dough for 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Unwrap the dough and roll it into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.  Fit the pie crust dough into a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges so that only 1/2-inch extends over the edge.  Fold the edges under and crimp.  Freeze the pie crust for 15 minutes.  Line the pie crust with parchment paper and fill it completely with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake the pie crust until it is set and the edge is light brown, about 15 minutes.  Transfer the pie crust from the oven and remove the pie weights from the crust.

Butter and flour two 8-inch, 1 9x13-inch, or 3 6-inch round pans with coconut oil or vegan cooking spray and dust with gluten-free flour (adjust number/size of pans if altering batch size). Shake out excess. Set aside. Prepare flax eggs in a large mixing bowl by mixing flaxseed meal and water and let rest for 5 minutes. To the flax eggs, add oil and maple syrup and whisk to combine. Next, add applesauce, sugars, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon and whisk to combine. Add lesser amount of almond milk (3/4 cup or 180 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and stir. Add grated carrot and stir. Then add almond flour and gluten-free flour blend and stir. The batter should be thick but pourable. If too thick, add remaining almond milk 1/4 cup or 60 ml as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). If adding walnuts, add at this time and stir. Divide evenly among cake pan(s). Bake for 40-50 minutes or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. When you press on the top, it shouldn’t feel too spongy, so don’t be afraid of over-baking! The gluten-free blend just takes a little longer to bake. Also, note that the size of pan you use will vary baking time. Remove from oven and let rest in the pans for 15 minutes.

If your 8” pans aren’t at least 2” deep, use 9” pans., Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess	"To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the center. Lightly grease two 8” x 2” or 9” x 2” round cake pans; for extra protection against sticking, line the bottom of the pans with parchment rounds (you can cut these yourself or use precut 8” or 9” rounds), and grease the parchment. If your 8” pans aren’t at least 2” deep, use 9” pans.

Weigh your @all-purpose flour{240%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

In a #small bowl{}, combine the flour, @salt{1.25%tsp}, and @baking powder{2%tsp}. Set aside.

In a #large mixing bowl{}, either using an #electric hand mixer or stand mixer{} with whisk attachment, beat the @eggs{4%large}, @granulated sugar{2%cups}, @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, and @almond extract (optional){1/8%tsp}, until thickened and light gold in color, about ~{2%minutes} at medium-high speed. If your stand mixer doesn’t have a whisk attachment, beat for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. The batter should fall in thick ribbons from the beaters, whisk, or paddle.

Add the dry ingredients to the mixture in the bowl and mix — by hand or on low speed of a mixer — just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix again briefly, to fully incorporate any residual flour or sticky bits.

In a saucepan set over medium heat or in the microwave, bring the @whole milk{1%cup} just to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the @unsalted butter{57%g} and @vegetable oil{1/3%cup}, stirring by hand until the butter has melted.

Slowly mix the hot milk-butter-oil mixture into the batter, stirring on low speed of a mixer until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth.

Divide the batter evenly between the two pans. You’ll use about 2 3/4 cups (about 580 g) in each.

Bake the cakes until the edges are pulling away from the sides of the pan, a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set. This should take 26 to ~{30%minutes} for two 9” pans, or 38 to 42 minutes for two 8” pans; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the cakes should read 205°F. Remove the cakes from the oven, carefully loosen the edges, and allow them to cool for ~{15%minutes} in the pans. Then turn them out of the pans and transfer them to a #cooling rack{}, right-side up, to cool to room temperature.

To make the frosting: In a #large mixing bowl{} or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together — by hand or mixer — the @cocoa powder{106%g}, 1 cup (113g) of the @confectioners’ sugar{454%g}, and the @salt{1/4%tsp}. Stir in the @hot water{74%g} and @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, scraping the bowl if necessary.

Add the @unsalted butter{284%g} and remaining confectioners’ sugar, stirring to combine. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the frosting at medium-high speed for 1 to ~{2%minutes}, until lightened in color and fluffy, stopping halfway through to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. When the frosting is ready, scoop out a bit on your #spatula{}; does it seem nicely spreadable? If it's too stiff, beat in water (1 teaspoon at a time) until it's the consistency you want.

To assemble the cake: Place one of the cake layers on a serving plate; tuck pieces of waxed or parchment paper underneath the edge of the cake to keep the plate clean. Spread the bottom layer with about 1 cup of frosting, enough to make a 1/4” to 1/2”-thick layer. Center the second layer bottom-side up (for a flat top) over the frosted layer and press gently to set it in place.

If your schedule permits, place the cake in the refrigerator or freezer, uncovered, for at least ~{30%minutes} (or up to 2 hours) to firm it up. This will make the layers less likely to slide around as you work, and the cake won’t shed crumbs as you frost. If you’re pressed for time, you can skip this step.

To finish the cake: For the best-looking cake, do the frosting in two steps. First, spread a very thin layer of frosting around the sides and across the top; this is called a crumb coat. You should be able to see the cake through the frosting in spots, it’s that thin. Refrigerate the cake for ~{20%minutes} to let this layer set. Again, skip this step if time is a factor.

Once the cake is chilled, use the remaining frosting to coat it thoroughly and evenly; our cake styling guide offers six pro-style options for ""styling"" your cake. If you have any leftover frosting, you can use it to pipe decorations on the top and/or around the base.

Store the cake, covered, at room temperature, or in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot. Let it come to room temperature before serving. For tips on slicing, see The best way to cut cake."	No Cooklang format found.

Return the pan to low heat and bring to a simmer. Add 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter and a  generous pinch of kosher salt. Whisk until the sauce is very smooth, then remove the pan from the heat. Beat the cream cheese with the whisk attachment on medium speed until very smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds. With the mixer running, very gradually add 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, stopping to scrape down the bowl as needed, and beat until smooth.

Grease and line the cake tins with butter and baking paper. Weigh the eggs – 3 medium eggs in their shells weigh around 175g – then use this same weight for the butter, sugar and flour. Put the soft (but not oily) butter into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a food-mixer and beat well with a wooden spoon or the whisk attachment until very creamy and mayonnaise-like. Scrape down any butter mixture from the sides of the bowl with a plastic spatula, then gradually beat in the sugar a couple of tablespoons at a time. Scrape the mixture off the sides of the bowl again and beat well for 1 minute or until the mixture looks very light and fluffy. Scrape down the mixture again. Break the 3 eggs into a small jug, add the ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract and beat with a fork just until the eggs are broken up. Gradually add to the butter mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. If the mixture looks like it might be ‘splitting’ or curdling, rather than appearing smooth and creamy, stir in a tablespoon of the flour with each of the last two additions of egg. Sift the rest of the flour onto the mixture. Start to gently fold in the flour with a large metal spoon or plastic spatula and after two or three movements add the warm water. Keep folding in until the flour is well mixed in and there are no streaks. Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins - if you want to be really precise, use your scales, or just do it by eye, then spread it evenly. Bake for 20–25 minutes until the sponges are a light golden brown, and starting to shrink back from the sides of the tin. (Check the sponges after 15 minutes and if they aren't baking evenly rotate the trays.) Check that the sponge springs back when lightly pressed in the middle. When cooked, take them out of the oven and run a round-bladed knife around the inside of each tin to loosen the sponge. Leave for a minute to firm up, then carefully turn out the cakes onto a wire rack. Leave until they are completely cooled. If you are using cream, put a bowl and whisk (or whisk attachment) in the fridge to chill. To assemble the cake, set one sponge crust-side down on a serving plate. Using the back of a tablespoon, evenly spread the sponge with the 6 tablespoons of raspberry jam. Pour the cream, if using, into the chilled bowl and whip with the chilled whisk or attachment until it thickens and soft peaks form when you lift out the whisk. Spoon the cream onto the cake and then gently smooth it evenly over the jam. Top with the second sponge, crust-side up, and dust with icing sugar.<br><br><em>Photography: David Munns © Hodder & Stoughton</em>	"Preheat the oven to 180°C / 160°C fan / 350°F / Gas 4.

Sift the rest of the flour onto the mixture. Start to gently fold in the flour with a #large metal spoon or plastic spatula{} and after two or three movements add the @warm water{1%Tbsp}. Keep folding in until the flour is well mixed in and there are no streaks.

Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins - if you want to be really precise, use your scales, or just do it by eye, then spread it evenly.

Bake for 20 to ~{25%minutes} until the sponges are a light golden brown, and starting to shrink back from the sides of the tin. (Check the sponges after 15 minutes and if they aren't baking evenly rotate the trays.) Check that the sponge springs back when lightly pressed in the middle.

When cooked, take them out of the oven and run a #round-bladed knife{} around the inside of each tin to loosen the sponge. Leave for ~{1%minute} to firm up, then carefully turn out the cakes onto a #wire rack{}. Leave until they are completely cooled.

If you are using @whipping cream (optional){150%ml}, put a bowl and whisk (or whisk attachment) in the fridge to chill.

To assemble the cake, set one sponge crust-side down on a serving plate. Using the back of a tablespoon, evenly spread the sponge with the 6 tablespoons of @raspberry jam{6%Tbsp}.

Pour the cream, if using, into the chilled bowl and whip with the chilled whisk or attachment until it thickens and soft peaks form when you lift out the whisk. Spoon the cream onto the cake and then gently smooth it evenly over the jam. Top with the second sponge, crust-side up, and dust with @confectioners' sugar{}."

Put the soft (but not oily) butter into a #large mixing bowl or the bowl of a #food-mixer and beat well with a #wooden spoon or the whisk attachment until very creamy and mayonnaise-like. Scrape down any butter mixture from the sides of the bowl with a #plastic spatula, then gradually beat in the sugar a couple of tablespoons at a time. Scrape the mixture off the sides of the bowl again and beat well for 1 minute or until the mixture looks very light and fluffy. Scrape down the mixture again. Break the eggs into a #small jug, add the @vanilla{3/4%tsp} and beat with a #fork just until the eggs are broken up. Gradually add to the butter mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time.

Slowly beat in the vegetable oil., Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess., Add the flour, salt, and baking powder to the egg mixture in the bowl, beating just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then beat again, to fully incorporate any sticky bits., In a saucepan set over medium heat, bring the butter and milk just to a boil. Add the vanilla. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir the mixture until the butter is completely melted., Slowly add the hot milk mixture to the cake batter, mixing until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth. The batter will be very thin., Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans., Bake the cakes for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set. Remove the cakes from the oven, cool them in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn them out onto a rack to cool completely., To make the filling: In a medium-sized saucepan, stir together 2 cups (454g) of the milk, the sugar, and the salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar., Meanwhile, whisk the cornstarch, egg yolks, and whole egg with the remaining 1/2 cup (113g)milk., Whisk about half of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks/cornstarch to temper the yolks. This keeps them from turning to scrambled eggs when you add them to the simmering milk., Pour the egg/milk mixture back into the remaining simmering milk in the pan, pouring it through a strainer to capture any bits of egg., Bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat (this may happen very quickly), stirring constantly with a whisk, and cook for 2 minutes; the mixture will thicken significantly., Remove the filling from the heat and stir in the vanilla., Transfer the filling to a heatproof bowl, and top it with a piece of buttered plastic wrap (make sure it touches the top of the filling so it doesn't develop a skin). Refrigerate until cool., When the cakes and pastry cream are completely cool, spread the filling in an even layer over one layer then stack the second layer on top. Set aside., To make the glaze: Melt the chocolate and cream together until smooth and lump-free. Add the vanilla and stir well.

In a #saucepan{} set over medium heat, bring the @unsalted butter{57%g} and @whole milk{227%g} just to a boil. Add the @vanilla{2%tsp}. Remove the pan from the heat, and stir the mixture until the butter is completely melted.

Slowly add the hot milk mixture to the cake batter, mixing until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth. The batter will be very thin.

Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans.

Bake the cakes for 30 to ~{35%minutes}, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set. Remove the cakes from the oven, cool them in the pans for ~{10%minutes}, then turn them out onto a #cooling rack{} to cool completely.

To make the filling: In a medium-sized saucepan, stir together 2 cups (454g) of the @whole milk{567%g}, the @granulated sugar{99%g}, and the @salt{0.25%tsp}. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.

Meanwhile, whisk the @cornstarch{39%g}, @egg yolks{3%large}, and whole @egg{1} with the remaining 1/2 cup (113g)milk.

Whisk about half of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks/cornstarch to temper the yolks. This keeps them from turning to scrambled eggs when you add them to the simmering milk.

Pour the egg/milk mixture back into the remaining simmering milk in the pan, pouring it through a strainer to capture any bits of egg.

Bring the mixture to a low boil over medium heat (this may happen very quickly), stirring constantly with a whisk, and cook for ~{2%minutes}; the mixture will thicken significantly.

Remove the filling from the heat and stir in the @vanilla{2%tsp}.

Transfer the filling to a heatproof bowl, and top it with a piece of buttered plastic wrap (make sure it touches the top of the filling so it doesn't develop a skin). Refrigerate until cool.

When the cakes and pastry cream are completely cool, spread the filling in an even layer over one layer then stack the second layer on top. Set aside.

To make the glaze: Melt the @semisweet chocolate{57%g} and @heavy cream{57%g} together until smooth and lump-free. Add the @vanilla{0.5%tsp} and stir well. Let the glaze sit for about ~{10%minutes} to cool a bit and to thicken just a touch. Pour the glaze over the filled cake. Serve immediately, or cool to room temperature, and refrigerate until ready to serve.

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), whip egg yolks and 1/4 cup of sugar with an electric mixer until thick and pale. Transfer mixture to a different bowl, scraping the bowl clean. Rinse off the beater. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), whip egg whites. Once the mixture starts to thicken, add the remaining ½ cup sugar and continue beating. Once stiff peaks form add vanilla and beat to combine. Gently stir in egg yolk mixture on low speed. Add flour and salt and gently stir or fold in with a spatula. The batter should be thick and pale yellow. Pour about 1 cup of batter into the center of each square traced on the parchment paper. Evenly spread it out to fit the square, leaving about ¼” border. The batter should be about 1/2” thick. Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, until set and very lightly browned. Carefully transfer parchment paper to a wire rack to cool. Once cooled, carefully  remove the lady finger squares from the parchment paper, set aside to use in the recipe. Brew coffee and let it cool. (or use instant coffee or instant espresso and brew 1 ¾ cups). Whisk the rum into the coffee, then pour the mixture into a large dish or baking pan that will fit the layers.Set aside. In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks, milk and sugar until combined. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture boils. Turn heat to medium- low and boil for 1 minute, remove from heat and transfer the mixture to a container with lid – but don’t put the lid on yet. Leave the lid open and whisk the mixture every few minutes until it’s cooled slightly. Then put the lid on and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. NOTE:this can be donebefore you bake the lady fingers, if desired, so it has time to cool. It can even be done the day before and chilled overnight.

Gently fold in beaten whipping cream. Quickly dip one of the three lady finger layers into the soaking liquid for about 5-10 seconds. Do not drop it in and let it sit or it will soak up too much liquid and fall apart. Remember, homemade lady fingers are more delicate than store-bought. If using hard store-bought you will need to soak them longer. Place it in the bottom of the baking dish you used to trace the shape. Spread 1/3 of the filling mixture evenly on top of the layer.

Pour about 1 cup of batter into the center of each square traced on the parchment paper. Evenly spread it out to fit the square, leaving about 1/4 inch border. The batter should be about 1/2 inch thick.

Sprinkle @confectioners' sugar{} on top of the ladyfinger batter to get a nice golden top.

Bake in preheated oven for 10 to ~{12%minutes}, until set and very lightly browned. Carefully transfer parchment paper to a #wire rack{} to cool.

Once cooled, carefully remove the lady finger squares from the parchment paper, set aside to use in the recipe.

Make the soaking liquid: Brew @coffee{1.75%cups}. Let cool. (or use instant coffee or instant espresso and brew 1 3/4 cups).

Whisk the @rum (optional){1/3%cup} into the coffee, then pour the mixture into a #large dish or baking pan{} that will fit the layers. Set aside.

Make the filling: In a #medium saucepan{}, whisk together @egg{6} yolks, @whole milk{1/2%cup} and @granulated sugar{1%cup} until combined.

Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture boils. Turn heat to medium low and boil for ~{1%minute}, remove from heat and transfer the mixture to a container with lid, but don't put the lid on yet. Leave the lid open and whisk the mixture every few minutes until it’s cooled slightly. Then put the lid on and chill in the refrigerator for ~{1%hour}.

NOTE: this can be done before you bake the lady fingers, if desired, so it has time to cool. It can even be done the day before and chilled overnight.

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), Beat the @heavy whipping cream{1.5%cups} and @confectioners' sugar{1/4%cup} until stiff peaks form, transfer to a different bowl.

In the same bowl used to beat whipping cream (but with the cream no longer in it), beat the @chilled custard mascarpone{16%oz} and @vanilla{2%tsp} with the paddle attachment until combined.

Gently fold in beaten whipping cream.

Add cooled custard mixture and beat until combined. Set aside.

Putting it together: Quickly dip one of the three lady finger layers into the soaking liquid for about 5 to 10 seconds. Do not drop it in and let it sit or it will soak up too much liquid and fall apart. Remember, homemade lady fingers are more delicate than store-bought. If using hard store-bought you will need to soak them longer.

Place it in the bottom of the baking dish you used to trace the shape.

Spread 1/3 of the filling mixture evenly on top of the layer.

Repeat with the second and third lady finger layers and remaining custard. Alternating soaked lady finger, custard, soaked lady finger, custard.

Sprinkle @unsweetened cocoa powder{1%Tbsp} over the top custard layer.

Add any additional flour as needed (I've found that sometimes I need as much as an additional ⅓ cup), stirring until the dough is forming into a cohesive, elastic ball and is beginning to pull away from the sides of the bowl (see video above recipe for visual cue). The dough will still be slightly sticky but still should be manageable with your hands. Drizzle a separate, large, clean bowl generously with olive oil and use a pastry brush to brush up the sides of the bowl. Lightly dust your hands with flour and form your pizza dough into a round ball and transfer to your olive oil-brushed bowl. Use your hands to roll the pizza dough along the inside of the bowl until it is coated in olive oil, then cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and place it in a warm place. Allow dough to rise for 30 minutes or until doubled in size. If you intend to bake this dough into a pizza, I also recommend preheating your oven to 425F (215C) at this point so that it will have reached temperature once your pizza is ready to bake. Once the dough has risen, use your hands to gently deflate it and transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth (about 3-5 times). Use either your hands or a rolling pin to work the dough into 12"" circle. Transfer dough to a parchment paper lined pizza pan and either pinch the edges or fold them over to form a crust. Drizzle additional olive oil (about a Tablespoon) over the top of the pizza and use your pastry brush to brush the entire surface of the pizza (including the crust) with olive oil. Use a fork to poke holes all over the center of the pizza to keep the dough from bubbling up in the oven.

Peel and discard the papery outer layers of the whole garlic bulb. Leave intact the skins of the individual cloves of garlic Using a sharp knife, cut 1/4 to a 1/2 inch from the top of cloves. This exposes the individual cloves of garlic. Put garlic in baking pan or muffin tin: Place the garlic heads in a baking pan, cut side up. (A muffin pan works great for this, as it keeps the garlic bulbs from rolling around.) Drizzle with olive oil: Drizzle a couple teaspoons of olive oil over each exposed head, using your fingers to rub the olive oil over all the cut, exposed garlic cloves. Cover the bulb withaluminum foil. Bake: Bake at 400°F (205°C) for 30-40 minutes, or until the cloves are lightly browned and feel soft when pressed. Cool and remove roasted garlic cloves from their skins: Allow the garlic to cool enough so you can touch it without burning yourself. Use a small small knife cut the skin slightly around each clove. Use a cocktail fork or your fingers to pull or squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins. Eat as is (I love straight roasted garlic) or mash with a fork and use for cooking.

Since it’s leafy plant matter which disintegrates more easily, it may be a good idea to take it out. My leaves went from a vibrant green in the beginning to kind of a dull brown by the end so I took them out just to be safe – I poured my mint extract into another container through a #sieve and discarded the mint leaves, then poured the filtered extract back into the bottle.)

Peel thin strips of zest from ½ of your orange. Place zest into your glass bottle. Add vodka, filling up to the neck of the bottle. Every few days, tilt your bottle upside down to gently mix the liquid inside. After ~{5-6%weeks}, you have extract! (I think with citrus peels the acid (and alcohol bath), it’s probably safe to leave the peels inside the bottle like a vanilla bean for re-fill purposes. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this, take it out!)

Peel thin strips of zest from your lemon. Place zest into your glass bottle. Add vodka, filling up to the neck of the bottle. Every few days, tilt your bottle upside down to gently mix the liquid inside. After ~{5-6%weeks}, you have extract!

Chop your @raw, unsalted almonds{10} small enough to fit in your jar. Place chopped almonds into your jar. Note: For the almond extract, it is probably best to use, or re-use, a larger jar. Then as few as 8 almonds, which have been skinned, chopped and covered with the alcohol or glycerin in a small jar if using. I would use a larger jar and a handful of almonds, as many as you like. Cover the chopped almonds to about one inch over the ingredients and proceed. Then, when it is ready, you can strain it into smaller bottles and proceed to use the same almonds for a second batch. To skin the almonds you first blanch them. This means plunging them into #boiling water for ~{1%minute} exactly. Wash under cold running water until they are quite cold, then squeeze the nut out of the skin, or rub it off in a clean tea cloth."

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, yogurt, vegetable oil, melted butter and vinegar together until smooth. Pour the egg mixture into the flour and bring everything together to form a dough. Tip out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 10 minutes, until smooth, then divide it into six pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, then place the balls on a plate or baking tray, cover them with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the syrup. Place the sugar, honey and lemon slices in a pan with 200ml of water. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes to infuse. Remove the syrup from the heat, pour into a heatproof jug, stir in the rosewater and leave to cool. Lightly dust the work surface with cornflour. Roll out one of the balls of dough to a circle about 30cm diameter. Dust the top with cornflour, then fold the right-hand edge to the centre and the left-hand edge to the centre, so that they meet. Dust again with cornflour, then fold the top down to the centre and the bottom up to the centre, to give a rough square. Dust again with cornflour. Take each corner and fold them inwards so they meet in the middle to make a smaller square. Dust again with cornflour, then repeat Step 6, folding the corners into the middle again to give an even smaller square. Turn the dough over (joins underneath), cover it and leave it to rest for 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining five balls of dough until you have six small squares. Make the filling. Mix the walnuts, pistachios, sugar, cinnamon and cardamom together in a bowl. To assemble, roll out one of the squares of dough to a rough 30cm-diameter circle.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/ingredients/pastry-dough/Pâte Brisée.source	Pâte Brisée		450 g all-purpose flour,2 Tbsp granulated sugar,1 tsp salt,20 Tbsp unsalted butter,152 g ice water	In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt	"In a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{450%g}, @granulated sugar{2%Tbsp}, and @salt{1%tsp}.

Add the cold @unsalted butter{20%Tbsp} to the bowl with the dry ingredients and toss, separating the pieces and coating them in the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to quickly break and smash the pieces of butter into smaller bits (it’s OK if some of the butter is left in large pieces; you’ll break it up more in the next step). Make a well in the center of the bowl and add 2/3 cup (152g) of the @ice water{152%g}. Toss with a #fork{} to distribute the water until you have a clumpy mixture with lots of dry spots.

Tip the contents of the bowl out onto a clean work surface. Use a #bench knife or bowl scraper{} to chop up the mixture, breaking up the clumps and pieces of butter and periodically using the scraper to toss and push the mixture back into a pile. Continue to chop and toss the mixture until it’s broken down into small, uniform pieces with very few floury spots and the butter pieces are no larger than a pea. This process helps bring the dough together without working it excessively, increasing tenderness.

Push the mixture into a pile and squeeze it with your hands so it holds together in large pieces. If you still have some dry floury areas, move any large pieces to one side, leaving the dry bits in the pile. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of ice water over the floury area, then use the bench knife or bowl scraper in the same chopping motion to evenly distribute the water. Squeeze the dough to bring it together, move the large pieces to the side, then repeat with more ice water as needed until no dry flour remains on the surface.

Use your hands to pat the dough firmly into a square, then use a floured rolling pin to flatten the square until it’s 3/4 inch thick. Pat around the four sides with your hands or the scraper to square off and compact the dough then cut it in half.

Lift one half up (again, using the scraper to help) and place it directly on top of the other. Use the scraper to lift the stack of dough and dust underneath with more flour, then roll over it with the #rolling pin{} to flatten and lengthen it slightly, dusting the top with flour if needed to prevent sticking. Cut the dough in half again, this time crosswise, and stack the halves again. The stacking and flattening increases the flakiness of the dough and further distributes the moisture, making it easier to roll out.

Working quickly, use the scraper to loosen the dough from the surface and dust underneath and on top with more flour, then flatten it with the rolling pin into a long rectangle measuring 3/4"" thick.

If making the Walnut & Oat Slab Pie leave the rectangle whole. If making a round pie, cut the rectangle in half crosswise to make 2 equal portions. Whatever form the dough takes when it’s chilled is the form it will most easily assume when being rolled out, so if it’s destined to be round, as for a pie, use the heel of your hand to round off any corners and press the portion(s) into more of a disk shape. If it’s destined to be rectangular, pat around the sides to straighten and square off the corners.

Wrap each piece in your favorite #reusable wrapper{}, maintaining the round or rectangular shape. Roll over the wrapped pieces with the rolling pin to flatten the dough and force it to fill out the wrap (applying this pressure will help prevent cracking later).

Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and chill until it’s very cold and firm, at least ~{2%hours}. If a recipe requires a single portion of dough, freeze the other portion and save it for another use.

To roll out the chilled pastry dough: Remove the cold pastry dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or two to soften slightly. Unwrap the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface.

Use a rolling pin to beat the dough evenly across the surface, applying enough force to leave an imprint but not enough to crack or splinter it. If rolling it into a round, beat the dough diagonally in both directions to make an X, then roll lengthwise and widthwise. Lift and rotate the dough every couple of whacks to keep the round shape. If rolling it into a square or rectangle, beat the dough lengthwise across the entire surface, then rotate it 90° (a quarter turn) and beat crosswise, repeating several times in both directions. Continue to beat the dough, lifting it frequently and adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking, until it’s just under 1/2 inch thick. This will make the dough pliable and easier to roll out while still cold.

Dust underneath and on top of the dough with more flour, then roll it out, frequently lifting and rotating the dough to work it into a round, or turning it 90° every so often and rolling it lengthwise and crosswise for a square or rectangle. Continue to roll, keeping the dough moving on the work surface and dusting it with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have the size and/or thickness specified in the recipe. If it starts to feel soft or sticky, transfer the dough to a baking sheet and freeze until it’s cold and firm, about 10 minutes, then proceed."

The dough can be used immediately or refrigerated until ready to use (1-2 days max). Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). You can also make small individual balls with the dough and roll out each individual ball to a round shape (doesn't need to be perfectly round) - if you have a tortilla press you can use it to flatten the dough balls. Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator/freezer to use later. To assemble the empanadas or turnovers, place a spoonful of the filling on the middle of each empanada disc. The amount of filling will vary based on the size of the empanada, but in general, it’s easier to seal an empanada that isn’t overstuffed. Also, the more you make empanadas, the easier it becomes to stuff them to the max and still seal them properly. To seal the empanadas, fold the disc and seal the edges by pressing the dough with your fingers.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the cashews, cornstarch, nutritional yeast, salt and pepper, smoked paprika, and garlic powder. Pulse a few times to break down the cashews slightly, then turn the processor on until you achieve a fine meal (see photo), about 30-45 seconds. Transfer the cashew coating to a shallow bowl or dish. Next, make the vegan buttermilk in a separate shallow bowl or dish by combining the dairy-free milk and lemon juice. Mix and set aside to curdle. Then add 1/2 cup cornstarch (56 g) to another shallow bowl and set aside (adjust the amount of cornstarch if altering the default number of servings). Cut your pressed tofu into 1-inch (2 ½ cm) cubes, and start the assembly line! Using clean hands, start by coating your tofu in cornstarch and gently tapping on the side of the bowl to shake off any excess. Next, dip in the vegan buttermilk and evenly coat, then place in the cashew coating and turn the tofu a few times to evenly coat all sides. Place your breaded nugget on the prepared baking sheet and repeat with the remaining tofu. Bake for 30 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the tofu nuggets are slightly golden, dry, and bouncy to the touch. Let cool slightly before serving with your favorite sauce — we love them with tartar sauce, ketchup, ""honey"" mustard, ranch, or BBQ sauce. If serving to kids, it’s best to slice the nuggets in half to help the insides cool off. Leftovers keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.

Beat on medium-high until light, fluffy, and doubled in volume, 2 to 3 minutes, using a rubber spatula to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce the mixer to low and add the eggs one at a time, adding the next egg only after the previous one is fully incorporated, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the wet ingredients. With the mixer still on low, add the the dry ingredients in three equal parts, alternating with the wet ingredients in two parts. Beat until just combined, then scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl once more, then beat on low for an additional 30 seconds. Add the blueberries. Take ½ cup of the blueberries and crush them with your hands so they are juicy; add to the batter and increase the mixer speed to high for 5 to 10 seconds to encourage the berries to release their juices even more. Immediately reduce the mixer to low and add the rest of the berries, mixing until incorporated evenly throughout the batter, another 30 seconds. Rest the batter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rest at room temperature for 1 hour. While the batter is resting, prep the oven and pan.While the batter is resting, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400℉ using the convect setting (if possible). Prepare two muffin tins by spraying the inside and border of every other cavity in the muffin tin generously with cooking spray. Portion the muffin batter into the muffin pan. Use a 1-Tablespoon or 3-Tablespoon cookie dough scoop to fill each sprayed cavity with 6 tablespoons of the batter. The first muffin tin will have six cavities filled, whereas the second muffin will will have three cavities filled. For the second muffin tin, you'll need to pour water into every other cavity to mimic the placement of the batter in the first muffin tin. Sprinkle the top of each cavity, aiming for the batter and avoiding the pan, with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar each. Bake the muffins. Bake each muffin tin for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the muffins are domed and golden brown around the edges. A skewer inserted into the center of a muffin should come out with a few crumbs attached. Cool the muffins. Cool the muffins in their muffin tin on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then use an offset spatula to run underneath the edges of the blueberry muffin tops to prevent them from sticking in the pan. Be careful to just run the offset spatula under the edges—you don't want to accidentally cut into the muffin bottom and decapitate the muffin from its top!After unsticking the muffin tops, keep cooling the muffins in the tins completely to room temperature.

Too long or too hot and the sauce will break. If the sauce becomes too thick on standing, whisk in a small amount of hot water to thin it. Enjoy

Set aside. In a medium or large saucepan, add the butter and melt over medium heat. The larger the pan you use, the quicker the process will be! Bring the butter to a boil, stirring frequently. As the water begins to boil out of the butter, the milk solids in the butter will separate, sink to the bottom, and begin to toast and brown. As this begins to happen, make sure to stir constantly so the butter browns evenly. It may become quite foamy, splatter a bit, and be difficult to see, so keep a close eye on it, removing from heat and continuing to stir if it starts to foam over. Once the butter has turned a nice nutty brown, remove from the heat and pour into a large liquid measuring cup to stop the cooking.

data/bronze/recipes/ignacio-gn_cook/main/pork/kakuni.source	kakuni		450 g pork belly,some  oil,1 knob ginger,2  green onions,some  water,3  eggs,some  dashi,some  sake,some  mirin,some  sugar,some  soy sauce,some  red chili pepper	Gather all the ingredients. I made quick dashi using a dashi packet (it only takes 3 minutes). Leave the eggs in the refrigerator until ready to use. Cut 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) in half to separate the green and white parts. Cut the green part into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Set aside the white part to make Shiraga Negi later for garnish (see how in To Serve below). Cut 1 knob ginger (unpeeled) into thin slices. Divide; set aside half for slow-cooking the pork and the other half for braising. Cut 1⅔ lb pork belly strips into shorter blocks that will lie straight when placed in a large pot later (I use a 4 QT Staub). If your pork belly is already in smaller blocks, you don't need to cut it. To sear, heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When it‘s hot, add ½ Tbsp neutral oil. Tip: Using the oil helps render the pork's fat faster. Place the pork belly fat side down in the hot skillet. (Do not overcrowd the pot. Sear in batches if you're doubling the recipe.) To prevent oil splatter, you can use a splatter screen. Tip: Searing the surface of the meat before boiling helps draw out excess fat and lock in the flavor. Sear the meat until all sides are nicely browned, about 2–3 minutes per side. Transfer the seared pork belly pieces to the large, heavy-bottomed pot. Lay them straight and in a single layer. To the pot, add ¼ cup sake and enough water to cover the meat. To start off, I added 1.5 QT or 1.5 L water for a single batch of the recipe; however, if there's enough room in your pot, add 2 QT or 2 L of water. Add the green part of the negi and half of the sliced ginger (save the other half for braising later). Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Tip: Boiling the meat removes the excess fat and scum while keeping the meat juicy. Skim the scum and fat with a fine-mesh skimmer, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Place an otoshibuta (drop lid) directly on top of the pork belly. You can buy an otoshibuta on Amazon or make one with aluminum foil following my post on How To Make Otoshibuta. Cook, uncovered, on a *gentle simmer*, for 3 hours. Leave off the pot lid so the unwanted odor goes away. Tip: I cannot emphasize enough that slow, gentle cooking is the key. If you cook on strong heat, the meat will become tough. When the liquid is running low, add more water or hot water (I added another 0.5 QT or 0.5 L) to the pot so the meat remains submerged at all times. Tip: Make sure the meat is not exposed, or else it will become dry. Meanwhile, boil enough water in a medium saucepan so the eggs will be completely submerged when added. Remove 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) from the refrigerator. Gently lower the cold eggs into the boiling water using a fine-mesh skimmer. Set a timer for 6½–7 minutes and soft-boil them on medium-low heat. As soon as the timer is up, transfer the eggs to a bowl of iced water to stop the cooking. Let them cool, peel them, and set aside. Bring a small amount of water in the same pot to a boil. Remove the tough strings from 5 snap peas and add them to the boiling water. Blanch them until tender, about 1½–2 minutes. Set aside until ready to serve. After cooking for 3 hours, remove the otoshibuta (drop lid) and check the meat for tenderness. Tip: For really tender pork belly, cook for at least 3 hours and add more water as needed to keep the meat fully submerged. Remove the pork belly to a tray or plate. If you'd like, you can strain and reserve the cooking liquid as a stock for other recipes. Let the liquid sit in the fridge and skim off any fat that floats to the top before using. Gently cut the pork belly into 2-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. The pork should be very tender by now, so handle carefully. Place the pieces in a single layer in a medium, heavy-bottomed pot (I use a 2.75 QT Staub). Tip: Use a medium pot for a tighter fit so the seasonings will completely cover the meat. If you use the same large pot as before, you may need to increase the amount of seasonings to cover the meat. Cut 1 dried red chili pepper (optional) in half and discard the seeds. If you like it spicy, you can include the seeds. Add 2½ cups dashi (Japanese soup stock), ¼ cup sake, ¼ cup mirin, ¼ cup sugar, and the dried red chili pepper. Add the rest of the ginger slices and place the otoshibuta (drop lid) on top. Do not cover with the pot's lid. Start cooking on medium heat. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low or medium low and cook, uncovered, on a gentle simmer. Set a timer for 1 hour. At the halfway point (30 minutes), add ¼ cup soy sauce. Tip: We add the soy sauce later on to keep the meat from cooking in it a long time and becoming salty. Add the peeled soft-boiled eggs to the pot. Place the otoshibuta (drop lid) on the meat and continue simmering, uncovered, for the remaining 30 minutes. If the cooking liquid gets low, reduce the heat to low (your stove's lowest setting). Occasionally, shake the pot to coat the meat and eggs with the braising liquid. Make sure there‘s enough liquid in the pot so the pork and eggs don‘t burn. It should be plenty of liquid; if your liquid is low, you might have been cooking on higher heat. After braising for 1 hour, turn off the heat. It's now ready to serve. Use the white part of 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) to make shiraga negi. First, cut the white part into pieces that are 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Then, make a lengthwise incision to remove the soft green core (save it for another use). Stack the outer layers, holding them flat against the cutting board, and slice lengthwise into very thin julienned strips. Soak in a bowl of iced water for 5–10 minutes to remove the bitterness, and drain well. Tip: For step-by-step photos, see my tutorial on How To Make Shiraga Negi. Serve the Kakuni, eggs, and snap peas in individual bowls. Drizzle with some braising liquid and garnish on top with shiraga negi. Season with optional shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) for a spicy kick. For a more flavorful Kakuni, wait several hours before serving. Kakuni tastes best when gradually cooled in the braising liquid, allowing the food to absorb more flavors. Gently reheat thoroughly and serve. If you prefer a less oily Kakuni, serve it the next day. Let it cool completely, then refrigerate the pork belly in its braising liquid overnight. The next day, remove and discard the solidified fat. Gently reheat the Kakuni thoroughly and serve. You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days and in the freezer for a month	"Pound the @pork belly{450%g} on both sides to tenderize it

Part B: Using the #Kitchenaid{} whip, whip @whole eggs (large){2} and @white sugar{150%g} until pale and thickened. Should take ~{2-3 minutes}.
Part C: Add @buttermilk{1/4%cup} and @vanilla flavouring{1%tsp} to the eggs and sugar mixture. Stir to combine well.

If the dough appears a bit soft on the bottom, use a #plastic scraper{} to fold it while still in the bowl. Then turn out onto a flour surface on the counter top. Knead about 6 times using a little more flour if necessary. Remember that the more flour you use, the more dry the donut will become.
Set the kneaded dough on a #plate{} in the #fridge{} for about ~{20 minutes}. It will be soft and slightly sticky.
While dough is setting in the fridge, make the glaze. Use the paddle in the mixer add the @icing sugar{31/2%cups}. In a separate container, blend the @boiling water{1/4%cup}, @corn syrup{2%tsp}, @salt{pinch} and another 1/2 tsp of vanilla together then add to the icing sugar. Stir slowly. Add more hot water to suit the thickness of glaze you want. When making glaze, less is better when adding extra water. So once you have the walnut crunch ready to dip in glaze, do a test and if the glaze is too thick, blend in a wee bit more hot water.
Prepare the dough. Either cut them evenly and pre-shape individually, or roll out to a rectangular shape on a floured surface countertop. I generally like the individual pieces to be 5-6 inches long and 2 inches wide. Sometimes I like to make 12, sometimes 16 from a batch.
Cut out the shapes. Pick up each one and brush off the excess flour, I use a #natural bristle BBQ brush{}. Then set the pieces aside to sit while you prep the fryer. This sitting time will allow the baking power to work some.
Plug in your #fryer{} to bring it up to temperature. Our fryer maxes out at 374ºF on the dial. The true temp is likely 350º to 360º. Usually takes about ~{15 minutes} to warm up. The oil I use is generally canola oil, sometimes its vegetable oil. Sometimes it’s a mix of both. You will want some means to flip the donuts, I use two forks. And you will want some means to extract the donuts from the hot oil, I use the #basket{} that comes with the fryer.
Fry for ~{1 min 15 seconds} per side. You may have to adjust that frying time depending on your method. It definitely should not take any longer than ~{1 min 30 seconds} per side.
As soon as those 3 or 4 donuts come out of the fryer, dip them in glaze and set them on a rack for cooling."	"In a #pan, cook @butter{30%g} with @walnuts{90%g, chopped} until brown. Set aside to cool.

Add the @dried basil{}, just a pinch, and the @salt{} and @pepper{}.
Bring to a boil; lower the heat and simmer for ~{at least two hours}; the longer you simmer the soup, the richer it will be.  
Remove from heat and purée in blender until relatively smooth.
Put the soup back on simmer for another ~{two or three hours} before you wish to serve it, leaving the cover off and reheating it slowly.  This will make the soup richer still.
Add @5 percent cream{1½ cups} and @whole milk{1½ cups} until the soup seems a good consistency.  Simmer.
Melt the rest of the butter (i.e., 3 tbsp) in a frying pan.  Slice the remaining mushroom caps in two or three; you want these mushrooms for texture, so bigger is better.
Add the @dry sherry{2 tbsp}; it is a nice addition to the soup, but it is easy to add too much.
If you think the soup is too thick, you can dilute it with more cream or with some dry white wine.

Adjust salt and pepper if necessary.

Move the oil into a separate container and slightly scrape out the bowl with the rubber scraper.  You don't have to wash it before making the dressing.

Preheat oven to 350
Cut @bread{half loaf, 4-5 slices} into 5/8"" cubes.  Big meaty cubes, not those dinky little cubes you get everywhere else.
Drizzle a couple tbl of the garlic oil on a #cookie sheet{}, put the bread on, drizzle another couple tbl over it. 
Bake for ~{12 minutes}, until just golden, turning halfway.  Watch them the last few minutes as they turn quickly.
Remove from oven promptly and let cool.  
When they're completely cool -- a couple hours -- they will stay fresh in a zip-loc for weeks.

With the blender / food processor off, put in the bowl: the @egg{1}, @Worcestershire{1 tbl}, @dry mustard{1/2 tsp}, @anchovy paste or anchovy {about 1 tsp}, @black pepper{1 tsp}, and @salt{1/2 tsp} if you like extra salt

Have ready: the remaining 1c of garlic oil, #1 tbl measuring spoon{}, @Balsamic vinegar{1 tbl}, @White vinegar{2 tbls}

Turn on the food processor / blender.  
Slowly drizzle 1/3 of the oil in - it'll take you maybe ~{10 seconds}.  
Now alternate the vinegars and the remaining thirds of the oil. You can stop the machine before adding vinegar, but have it running when you add the oil.
Stop & scrape down the bowl, process another second or two. It should have the consistency of mayonnaise.

Do not have ready: bacon bits!! Caesar Salad does not have bacon bits. Spinach salad does.

Cut the @romaine{1 head} into 1"" pieces. Yes, I know you're supposed to tear.  Fuck that.  Chop the base parts of the leafs finer than the tops.  Place in #big salad serving bowl{}.
Pour half of the dressing over and toss until every piece has some dressing
