https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

Recipe Text: In a large saucepan, combine the milk, cream, and granulated sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is hot but not boiling. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and cornstarch. Gradually add the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the butter and vanilla extract. Strain the custard into a clean bowl and allow it to cool to room temperature. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the custard until chilled.

Tearing instead of cutting helps prevent bruising. Cut bell peppers into strips. Halve the cherry tomatoes and slice the sun-dried tomatoes into thin julienne strips.

Heat a frying pan, preferably cast-iron as it conducts heat well. Add a little oil and fry the beef loin or fillet in one piece, along with the bell or red peppers in the same pan.

In a mixing bowl, toss together the torn salad leaves, rocket salad, cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomatoes, and pesto sauce. Place the mixture in a heaped pile on a plate.
