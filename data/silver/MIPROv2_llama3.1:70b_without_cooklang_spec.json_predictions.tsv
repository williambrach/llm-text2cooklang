https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

You can use fresh or frozen fruit for this smoothie.	"Your conversion of the recipe into Cooklang format is almost correct. Here are some minor corrections:

1. In the first line, you used `@tomatoes`, but the original recipe mentioned ""Wash tomatoes, cucumber and red bell pepper"". Since there's no quantity specified for tomatoes, it should be just `@tomato` instead of `@tomatoes{50%g}`.

2. The quantities for some ingredients are not explicitly mentioned in the original recipe. For example, the quantity of lettuce is not specified. In such cases, you can omit the quantity or use a placeholder like `{?g}` to indicate that the quantity is unknown.

Here's the corrected Cooklang code:

```
Wash @tomato, @cucumber and @red bell pepper. 
Cut them into large chunks using a #knife. 
Tear up the @lettuce{?g} into small pieces. 
Mix together in a #bowl with @pesto{20%g} and @olives{20%g}.

Place on a #plate. 
Garnish with thinly sliced rings of @red onion{10%g} and blocks of @feta cheese{50%g}. 
If necessary, drizzle with a little @olive oil and season using #salt and #pepper.
```

As for the second recipe, your conversion is mostly correct. However, you used `@strawberries{50%g}` instead of just `@strawberry{50%g}`, since there's only one strawberry mentioned in the original recipe (although it's likely a typo and should be ""strawberries""). Also, you can omit the sentence ""You can use fresh or frozen fruit for this smoothie"" as it's not part of the cooking instructions.

Here's the corrected Cooklang code:

```
Blend @strawberry{50%g}, @banana{1}, @blueberries{50%g}, @milk{100%g}, @oat flakes{30%g}, @chia seeds{10%g}, @granola{10%g} and @salt{1%g} with a #blender{}.

"The provided text does not contain a Cooklang code snippet to analyze. However, I can provide general guidance on how to approach determining a missing ingredient in a recipe based on the given instructions and ingredients.

To determine the missing ingredient in the first recipe, let's break down the steps:

1. The recipe starts with cooking bacon.
2. It then adds string beans (frozen, freshly boiled, or canned) to the pan with the bacon.
3. After reducing heat and braising slowly, it instructs to fry chicken fillets in a second frying pan over medium heat for 2 minutes on each side.
4. The chicken is then added to the pan with the beans and everything is braised together.
5. A sauce is made by finely chopping dill florets, pickled onion, and garlic, stirring in salt to taste, and adding sour cream.

Given these steps, it seems that the primary ingredients are bacon, string beans, chicken fillets, dill, pickled onion, garlic, salt, and sour cream. However, there's no mention of what to do with the ingredient quantities provided at the beginning of the recipe snippet (e.g., @string beans{150%g}, @dill florets{5%g}, etc.), which suggests that these might be part of a larger recipe or formatting issue rather than an indication of missing ingredients.

Considering the steps and the explicit mention of ingredients, there doesn't seem to be a specific ingredient missing from the instructions provided. The quantities at the top appear to be a separate issue, possibly related to how the recipe is formatted or intended for scaling, but they don't directly indicate a missing step or ingredient within the context of the cooking instructions.

Therefore, based on the information given and focusing strictly on the steps outlined in the recipe, there isn't a clear indication of a missing ingredient."

Here's the corrected version:

**Cooklang:** Wash @tomatoes{200%g} and slice them into chunks, if they are cherry tomatoes, you can just halve them using a #knife. Peel @red onions{10%g} and slice them into thin rings, which you can then halve. Wash @coriander{10%g} and chop coarsely. Mix the tomatoes, onion and coriander in a #bowl and season with @salt{0.250%tsp}, #pepper, a splash of @olive oil and @Worcester sauce{10%g}. Enjoy as a simple side salad with any meal.

I made two minor changes:

1. Added `#knife` to specify the tool used for slicing.
2. Changed `pepper` to `#pepper` to indicate that it's a seasoning, not an ingredient with a specific quantity.

Your conversion is now spot on!"
