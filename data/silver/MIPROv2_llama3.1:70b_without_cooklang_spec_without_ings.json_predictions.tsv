To determine if the recipe text is well-written, let's break it down step by step:

**Recipe 1**

1. **Clarity**: The instructions are clear and concise, making it easy for the reader to follow along.
2. **Organization**: The steps are logically organized, starting with preparing the ingredients, then cooking the steak and vegetables, and finally assembling the dish.
3. **Specificity**: The recipe provides specific measurements for most ingredients (e.g., 50%g of fresh coriander) and cooking times (e.g., ~{12%minutes} in the oven).
4. **Consistency**: The use of symbols (e.g., @, #, ~) is consistent throughout the recipe, although it may be unfamiliar to some readers.
5. **Grammar and punctuation**: The text appears to be free of grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes.

However, there are a few areas for improvement:

1. **Unfamiliar notation**: The use of symbols (e.g., @, #, ~) may be confusing for some readers. Consider using more conventional notation or explaining the symbolism at the beginning of the recipe.
2. **Lack of descriptive language**: While the instructions are clear, the text could benefit from more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the dish and its components.
3. **Assumed knowledge**: The recipe assumes a certain level of cooking knowledge (e.g., how to grill a steak, roast vegetables). Consider adding more detailed explanations or tips for less experienced cooks.

**Recipe 2**

1. **Clarity**: The instructions are clear and concise, making it easy for the reader to follow along.
2. **Organization**: The steps are logically organized, starting with preparing the ingredients, then cooking the gelatine mixture, and finally assembling the dessert.
3. **Specificity**: The recipe provides specific measurements for most ingredients (e.g., 1 egg yoke) and cooking times (e.g., 15 minutes).
4. **Consistency**: The use of language is consistent throughout the recipe.
5. **Grammar and punctuation**: The text appears to be free of grammatical errors and punctuation mistakes.

However, there are a few areas for improvement:

1. **Lack of descriptive language**: While the instructions are clear, the text could benefit from more descriptive language to help the reader visualize the dish and its components.
2. **Assumed knowledge**: The recipe assumes a certain level of cooking knowledge (e.g., how to cook gelatine). Consider adding more detailed explanations or tips for less experienced cooks.

Overall, both recipes are well-written, but could benefit from some minor improvements to make them more accessible and engaging for readers."

https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

* Seasons and cooks a beef steak to desired doneness.
* Serves the dish with the chimichurri sauce.

**Recipe 2**

* Prepares onions and red bell peppers by peeling and slicing them.
* SautÃ©s the sliced vegetables in oil until softened.
* Adds various spices (cumin, smoked paprika, sugar) and chopped tomatoes to create a sauce.
* Simmers the sauce to reduce it slightly and seasons to taste.

Comparing these two recipes:

- **Number of ingredients**: Recipe 1 involves more ingredients than Recipe 2, including a variety of vegetables, herbs, and spices for the chimichurri sauce, plus beef steak. Recipe 2 focuses on fewer main ingredients with some added spices.
- **Preparation methods**: Recipe 1 requires multiple preparation methods (cutting different sizes, grilling, roasting), while Recipe 2 primarily involves slicing and sautÃ©ing.

Based on these factors, **Recipe 1** appears to be more complex due to the variety of ingredients, the need for precise cutting and cooking techniques, and the combination of different cooking methods."

"To determine the correct cooking time for the steak, let's break down the steps involved in cooking it:

1. **Grilling**: The steak is grilled in a frying pan over medium heat for 2 minutes on each side until seared and golden brown.

2. **Oven Cooking**: After grilling, the steak is placed in the oven along with the vegetables. The recipe mentions that the total cooking time in the oven can range from 6 to 10 minutes, depending on how well done you want the steak to be. This implies that the longer you cook the meat, the more well done it will become.

Given this information, we need to consider the following:

*   The initial grilling step is not included in the 6-10 minute oven cooking time range.
*   The recipe does not specify an exact temperature for the steak's internal temperature, which would be a more precise way to determine doneness.

Therefore, based on the provided instructions and without additional information about the desired level of doneness or internal temperature, we can conclude that the correct answer is indeed within the 6-10 minute range specified in the recipe."

You've broken down the complexity of each recipe into manageable parts, considering factors such as cooking techniques, ingredient management, and overall cooking process.

Your analysis highlights that Recipe 2 indeed requires more advanced cooking skills, including stir-frying and braising, which can be challenging for novice cooks. Additionally, the multiple components involved in Recipe 2, such as cooking quinoa rice, preparing the turkey or chicken, and managing the various vegetables, can make it overwhelming to execute.

In contrast, Recipe 1, while still requiring some basic cooking techniques, has a more straightforward cooking process with fewer components to manage. The steps involved are relatively simple, making it more accessible to cooks of varying skill levels.

Your assessment demonstrates a clear understanding of the complexities involved in each recipe and provides valuable insights for cooks looking to tackle new recipes. Well done!"

**Recipe 1: Turkey and Vegetable Braise**

* Number of ingredients: 9
* Number of steps: 6
* Complexity of steps:
	+ Chopping vegetables (easy)
	+ Cooking turkey and vegetables in a pan (moderate)
	+ Adding tomatoes, sugar, and salt (easy)
	+ Braising for 5 minutes (easy)
* Specialized equipment needed: large saucepan

**Recipe 2: Beef Tar-Tar**

* Number of ingredients: 7
* Number of steps: 5
* Complexity of steps:
	+ Dicing beef and onion (easy)
	+ Mixing with seasonings (easy)
	+ Toasting ciabatta (easy)
* Specialized equipment needed: griddle pan

Comparing the two recipes, we can see that both have a similar number of ingredients and steps. However, Recipe 1 requires cooking and braising, which might be considered more complex than the simple mixing and toasting in Recipe 2.

"To compare these two recipes, let's break down the steps involved in each:

**Recipe 1 (Chimichurri Steak)**

1. Prepare ingredients (herbs, chilli, garlic, red onion, peppers).
2. Mix herbs, chilli, and garlic with red onion and peppers.
3. Add salt, sugar, vinegar, and black pepper to the mixture.
4. Brush vegetables with olive oil and grill/roast them.
5. Season beef steak with salt and pepper, brush with cooking oil, and grill/fry it.
6. Finish cooking the steak in the oven.
7. Serve the steak with roasted vegetables and chimichurri sauce.

**Recipe 2 (Baked Salmon)**

1. Preheat the oven to 180 degrees.
2. Prepare ingredients (courgette, salmon steak, olive oil, salt, pepper, thyme).
3. Place courgette slices on parchment paper, drizzle with olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and thyme.
4. Place the salmon steak on top of the courgettes and season with salt.
5. Wrap the salmon and courgettes in parchment paper and bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
6. Make a sauce by heating double cream, horseradish, and salt in a saucepan until thickened.
7. Serve the baked salmon and courgettes with the sauce.

Now, let's compare these two recipes:

* Both recipes involve cooking protein (steak vs. salmon) and vegetables (peppers, onions, courgettes).
* Both recipes use olive oil for cooking and flavoring.
* Both recipes involve seasoning with salt and pepper.
* Recipe 1 has a more complex sauce (chimichurri) that requires mixing multiple ingredients, while Recipe 2 has a simpler sauce made from just three ingredients.
* Recipe 1 involves grilling/frying the steak, while Recipe 2 bakes the salmon in the oven.
* Recipe 1 serves the dish with roasted vegetables, while Recipe 2 serves it with baked courgettes.

Overall, both recipes have some similarities, but they also have distinct differences in terms of ingredients, cooking methods, and flavor profiles."

* Both recipes require some preparation of ingredients before cooking (e.g., mixing herbs and spices, tearing lettuce leaves).
* However, the two recipes differ significantly in their approach to sauce preparation: Recipe 1 makes a chimichurri sauce from scratch, while Recipe 2 uses pre-made pesto sauce.
* The presentation of the final dish also differs: Recipe 1 serves the steak with roasted vegetables and chimichurri sauce on top, while Recipe 2 arranges the salad ingredients on a plate and garnishes with grilled beef and bell peppers.
