https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

"It seems like you've provided a recipe for a Russian salad. To analyze this recipe using Cooklang, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cooking the corn beef**: This is the first step in preparing the salad. The recipe doesn't specify how to cook the corn beef, but it implies that it should be cooked before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.

2. **Steaming potatoes and carrots**: In this step, we're steaming the potatoes and carrots together for 10-15 minutes or until they are firm but tender when poked. This is a common method for cooking these vegetables without losing their nutrients.

3. **Steaming frozen peas**: The recipe instructs us to steam the frozen peas according to package directions. This ensures that we cook them correctly, as the steaming time may vary depending on the brand and type of peas used.

4. **Cooling and dicing potatoes and carrots**: After steaming, the potatoes and carrots need to cool down before being peeled and diced into 1cm cube-ish shapes. This step is crucial for ensuring that they are not too hot or too cold when added to the salad.

5. **Adding ingredients to the bowl**: In this step, we're adding the diced potatoes, carrots, steamed peas, and hardboiled eggs to a medium serving bowl. The recipe doesn't specify how to dice these ingredients, but it suggests that they should be cut into similar-sized pieces for even distribution in the salad.

6. **Adding pickles**: We're instructed to chop the pickles finely and add them to the bowl with the other ingredients. This step adds a tangy flavor and crunchy texture to the salad.

7. **Mixing everything together**: If using meat, we should mix it into the salad gently before adding the mayonnaise. This ensures that all the ingredients are well combined without being over-mixed or crushed.

8. **Adding mayonnaise**: The recipe suggests starting with one cup of mayonnaise and adjusting to taste. This is a common approach when making salads, as the amount of dressing needed can vary depending on personal preference.

9. **Chilling the salad**: After mixing everything together, we're instructed to cover the salad and chill it for at least one hour or overnight. This step allows all the flavors to meld together and the ingredients to absorb the mayonnaise evenly.

10. **Garnishing with dill**: Finally, we garnish the salad with finely chopped dill. This adds a fresh flavor and aroma to the dish, making it more appealing to eat.

Overall, this recipe provides a clear guide for making a Russian salad, from cooking the corn beef to chilling the finished product."

Finely chop the fresh coriander and parsley, then deseed and finely chop the red chilli, red onion and garlic clove. Mix the herbs, chilli and garlic with the red onion and peppers in a bowl, add salt, sugar, vinegar and freshly ground black pepper, mix thoroughly so that the acid dissolves the sugar and salt, into this mixture add a little olive oil, enough to create the desired consistency. Brush the vegetables lightly with olive oil and using a grill pan, heat over a high heat and roast the courgettes, aubergines and bell peppers. Then line a baking tray with tinfoil, place the courgettes on the foil and roast for 12 minutes in the oven. Season the beef steak with salt and pepper on both sides, brush with cooking oil and grill in a frying pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes on each side until seared and golden brown. After frying, place in the oven on the tray with the vegetables. Cook for 6-10 minutes, depending on how you want the steak done. The longer you cook the meat, the more well done the steak will be.

"It seems like you've provided a recipe in Cooklang format, which is a structured and machine-readable way of representing recipes. Here's my attempt to break down the reasoning step by step:

**Step 1: Prepare the vegetables**

* The recipe starts by preparing the vegetables, including courgettes, aubergines, bell peppers, coriander, parsley, red chilli, red onion, and garlic.
* These ingredients are listed with their respective quantities in percentage terms (e.g., @courgette{50%g}).

**Step 2: Mix the chimichurri sauce**

* The recipe then mentions mixing sugar and salt into a mixture, adding olive oil to create the desired consistency.

**Step 3: Roast the vegetables**

* The courgettes are brushed with olive oil and roasted in a grill pan over high heat.
* Then, they're placed on a baking tray lined with tinfoil and roasted for 12 minutes in the oven.

**Step 4: Cook the beef steak**

* The beef cut is seasoned with salt and pepper on both sides, brushed with cooking oil, and grilled in a frying pan over medium heat for 2 minutes on each side.
* After grilling, the steak is placed in the oven on the tray with the vegetables and cooked for 6-10 minutes, depending on the desired level of doneness.

**Step 5: Serve**

* Once the steak is cooked to the desired level of doneness, it's removed from the oven along with the roasted vegetables.
* The dish is then served with a drizzle of chimichurri sauce and garnished with extra chopped herbs.

The reasoning behind this recipe seems to be:

1. Prepare the ingredients for the dish.
2. Roast the vegetables in the grill pan and oven.
3. Cook the beef steak to the desired level of doneness.
4. Serve the dish with chimichurri sauce and garnish with fresh herbs.

Overall, the recipe appears to be a simple yet flavorful Argentinean-inspired dish featuring grilled steak and roasted vegetables, served with a tangy and herby chimichurri sauce."

1.  Rinse and prepare the fish (bream, cod, seabass, or catfish) by removing scales, fins, guts, and pat drying it.
2.  Prepare the vegetables (courgette, lemon, red bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, and red onion) by rinsing, peeling, slicing, and halving them.
3.  Drizzle the fish with lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and black pepper.
4.  Sauté the chopped vegetables in a frying pan with Provence herbs, salt, and pepper until they're tender.
5.  Place the fish on tin foil or baking paper on a flat baking tray, stuff it with the roasted vegetables, and bake for 15 minutes.
6.  Garnish the baked fish with fresh or roasted cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic cloves (which can be done while baking), and lemon wedges.

This recipe seems to suggest that you can cook the fish and vegetables together in the oven, which is a convenient way to prepare a meal. The use of tin foil or baking paper helps prevent the fish from sticking to the tray and makes cleanup easier."
