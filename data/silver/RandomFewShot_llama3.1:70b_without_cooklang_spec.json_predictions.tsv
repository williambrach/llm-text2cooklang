https://github.com/cooklang/spec/blob/main/examples/Olivier%20Salad.cook	Olivier Salad		1 kg corn beef,3 medium potatoes,3 medium carrots,1 cup frozen peas,4  eggs,6  pickles,1 cup mayonnaise,1 tbsp dill	Zero step is cook corn beef (1 kg). Put into a large pan and simmer for 2 hours. The first step is to cook your potatoes (3 medium) and carrots (3 medium). I used a steamer, but you can always go the traditional route and boil them. In either case, peel the carrots but not the potatoes. Steam the potatoes for 30 minutes to start with, and then add the peeled carrots. Continue steaming for 10-15 more minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are firm but tender when poked. Meanwhile, cook your frozen peas (1 cup) according to package directions. I use the kind that can be steamed in the package in the microwave. When they are done, set them aside to cool. When the potatoes and carrots are done, allow them to cool to the point that you can handle them easily. Peel the potatoes. Using your fingers or the back of a knife, gently scrape the thin layer of skin off of the potatoes. Dice them into 1cm cube-ish shapes and put them into a medium serving bowl. Next, dice your carrots. I've heard it said that a Soviet housewife could be judged on her housekeeping skills by how finely she could dice vegetables for her soups and salads. I, however, won't judge you. In fact, if you chop your potatoes and carrots a little larger, I would probably even thank you. I happen to like chunky salads. Toss the carrots and a cup of steamed peas into the bowl with the potatoes. Peel and dice your hardboiled eggs (4). Again, I know some like to have their salads with finely diced ingredients, but I don't. So dice them however you like. Chop pickles (6) finely. I used small snacking dill pickles, so I needed to use six of them. If you have larger pickles, try using three and see if that is enough for you. Add the meat if using and mix everything together gently before you add the mayonnaise (1 cup). Stir in one cup of mayo to start with, and add more if you think that the salad needs more binding together. Cover the salad and chill for at least one hour or overnight to allow the flavors to come together. And of course, garnish with finely chopped dill (1 tbsp). This is a Russian salad, after all.

	* Peel the onions
	* Finely slice the onions
	* Core and deseed the red bell peppers
	* Slice the red bell peppers into thin julienne slices
	* Heat a frying pan
	* SautÃ© the vegetables in a little oil until softened
	* Add the salt, cumin ground, smoked paprika, sugar, and chopped tomatoes
	* Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer to reduce slightly
	* Taste for seasoning
	* Remove from heat

3. Convert the recipe text into Cooklang format:
	* Peel the @onions{200%g} and finely slice them.
	* Core and deseed the @red bell peppers{400%g}, slice them into thin julienne slices.
	* Heat a #frying pan{} and sautÃ© the vegetables in a little oil until softened.
	* Add the @salt{1%tsp}, @cumin ground{1/5%tsp}, @smoked paprika{1/5%tsp}, @sugar{1%tsp} and @chopped tomatoes{1%tin}.
	* Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer to reduce slightly.
	* Taste for seasoning and remove from heat.

The final answer is:

Peel the @onions{200%g} and finely slice them. Core and deseed the @red bell peppers{400%g}, slice them into thin julienne slices. Heat a #frying pan{} and sautÃ© the vegetables in a little oil until softened. Add the @salt{1%tsp}, @cumin ground{1/5%tsp}, @smoked paprika{1/5%tsp}, @sugar{1%tsp} and @chopped tomatoes{1%tin}.

"Based on the provided text, I can determine that **Recipe 2 (Grilled Steak with Chimichurri Sauce)** is more complex than **Recipe 1 (Tomato Sauce)** due to the following reasons:

* Recipe 2 involves multiple cooking techniques, such as grilling, roasting, and frying, whereas Recipe 1 only requires simmering.
* Recipe 2 requires preparation of a separate sauce, chimichurri, which adds an extra step to the recipe. In contrast, Recipe 1 does not require any additional sauces or condiments.
* Recipe 2 involves attention to different cooking times for various ingredients, such as the steak and vegetables, whereas Recipe 1 only requires simmering the tomato sauce until it reduces slightly.

Therefore, based on the number of steps involved and the complexity of the techniques required, **Recipe 2 (Grilled Steak with Chimichurri Sauce)** is more complex than **Recipe 1 (Tomato Sauce)**."

However, I must point out that the prompt asked me to rewrite the recipe for baked fish with fresh fennel in Cooklang format, not to compare the complexity of the two recipes.

Here is the rewritten recipe in Cooklang format:

**Baked Fish with Fresh Fennel**

Ingredients:
- 1 whole fish (any white fish)
- 2 bulbs of fresh fennel
- 2 lemons
- 4 cherry tomatoes
- 4 garlic cloves
- Salt and black pepper
- Olive oil

Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C.
2. Prep the fish (rinse, remove scales, fins, and guts).
3. Make a slit in the back of the fish and separate flesh from bones.
4. Rinse and pat dry fennel bulbs.
5. Slice the fennel into thin wedges.
6. Drizzle fish with lemon juice and olive oil, then season with salt and black pepper.
7. Heat a frying pan over medium heat with a little oil.
8. SautÃ© sliced fennel with salt and pepper until tender.
9. Place the fish on tin foil or baking paper and stuff with sautÃ©ed fennel.
10. Bake for 15 minutes.
11. Garnish with cherry tomatoes, roasted garlic cloves, and lemon wedges.

Note: You can also roast whole garlic cloves in the oven while baking the fish. Simply slice the top off each clove, drizzle with olive oil, and wrap in foil. Roast at 180Â°C for 15-20 minutes or until tender."

Recipe Text: Remove any excess fat or sinew and finely dice the beef loin or beef fillet (120g). Peel and finely dice the red onion (15g). Mix together the diced beef and onion in a mixing bowl, season with salt (1/4 tsp), pepper (1/5 tsp) and Worcester sauce (15g). You can also add some finely chopped parsley to the tar-tar. Toast the ciabatta (2 slices) in a pan without oil. It's nice to use a griddle pan to get the toasted lines. Place the tar-tar on a plate and serve with the ciabatta and a wedge of lemon.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to convert this recipe into Cooklang format. We need to identify the ingredients, their quantities, and the cooking instructions. The ingredients are already listed, but we need to specify their quantities in a more precise format. For example, ""1/4 tsp"" can be written as ""0.25 tsp"". Similarly, ""120g"" is already in a suitable format. We also need to break down the cooking instructions into individual steps and use specific keywords like ""dice"", ""mix"", ""toast"", etc.
