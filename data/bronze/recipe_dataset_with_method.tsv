data/bronze/recipes/bwmcadams_food-cookbook/cookies/Mexican Hot Chocolate Cookies.source	Mexican Hot Chocolate Cookies		In a large bowl, stir the cocoa and molasses into the warm butter.  In medium bowl combine flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  Add sugar, egg and vanilla extract to the large bowl.  Stir dry ingredients into the wet.  Cover and chill dough for as little as an hour or up to 3 days. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Roll 1 tablespoon of dough into balls (a . cookie scoop is great for this), and roll them in the remaining white sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake cookies, one sheet at a time, for 10-12 minutes, until cookies are puffed, centers are set and they are beginning to form cracks.  Do not overbake.  Leave on sheets until they are cool enough to transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely. If you want a slightly more substantial cookie, use a . cookie scoop, 2 tablespoons dough, for each cookie.  You will need to add a minute or two to the bake time and the batch will make about 18 cookies instead of 30	60g  cocoa powder,170g  butter	"-- Source: https://www.bakersbrigade.com/recipe/chewy-mexican-hot-chocolate-cookies/

In a #large bowl{}, bloom the @cocoa powder{60g} by mixing the warm @butter{170g}, stirring until the cocoa is completey dissolved and the texture is smooth. 

Add molasses{2%Tbsp} to the large bowl with the bloomed cocoa, mixing the molasses until it too dissolves. Set the bowl aside to cool (so that it doesn't cook the other ingredients prematurely)

In a #medium bowl{}, combine @all purpose flour{192g}, @baking soda{1%1/2%tsp}, @salt{1/2%tsp}, @cinnamon{1%tsp}, and @cayenne pepper{1/8 - 1/4%tsp}

Once cooled, add @sugar{200g} (you will need to set aside another half cup of @sugar to roll doughballs in{100g}), @egg{1%large}, and @vanilla paste{1%tsp} to the large bowl.

Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients.

Cover and chill the dough in the #refrigerator{} for at least 1 hour, and up to 3 days.

When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

In a bowl or deep plate, place the additional 100g of sugar.

Using a #No. 50 cookie scoop{}, scoop dough into balls of approximately 1 tablespoon, and roll them in the sugar. A No. 50 should yield you about 30 cookies.

Place dough balls 2 inches apart on ungreased #baking sheets{} or #silicone baking mats (optional){}.

Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time, for ~dough balls{10-12%minutes} until cookies are puffed, centers are set, and they are beginning to form cracks. 

Leave the cookies on the sheets until they're cool enough to transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

* If you'd like a more substantial cookie, try using a #No. 30 cookie scoop (optional){}, which yields approx. 2 tablespoons of dough for each cookie. Add a minute or two to the bake time. This batch should make about 18 cookies (instead of the 30 cookies yielded by a No. 50)."

Put the cut-up butter in the freezer for a few minutes, while you work on the dry ingredients.  Combine the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a standing mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix for a few seconds, just to combine, then turn off.   Add the butter pieces to the dry ingredients. Mix on the lowest setting possible for 5 to 10 seconds—pulsing on/off if necessary, so the flour doesn’t fly out of the bowl—then turn off. Err on the side of undermixing at this step. You want each butter piece to be coated in flour and slightly bashed by the paddle, but most of the pieces should be barely smaller than when you started.  Turn on the mixer to the lowest setting possible, slowly pour in the 1/4 cup very cold water. Once it’s all in, let the mixer run for a couple more seconds, then turn off and check in with the dough. The end goal is a very shaggy dough that holds together when squeezed, with some dough starting to grab onto the paddle attachment, and a few flour streaks on the side of the bowl.

Add the water, whisking or stirring only until it forms a smooth, sticky batter (like pancake batter). Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature for approximately 2 hours, or until the mixture becomes very foamy and bubbly. It should swell to nearly double in size and collapse when the bowl is tapped on the countertop. 2. To make the dough, in the same mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer), add the additional yeast to the sponge and stir. Then add 3 cups of the flour and all of the salt and malt. Stir (or mix on low speed with the dough hook) until the ingredients form a ball, slowly working in the remaining ¾ cup flour to stiffen the dough. 3. Transfer the dough to the counter and knead for at least 10 minutes (or for 6 minutes by machine). Add the Asiago cheese during the last minute or so of kneading, and knead until evenly distributed. The dough should be firm, stiffer than French bread dough, but still pliable and smooth. There should be no raw flour - all the ingredients should be hydrated. The dough should pass the windowpane test and register 77 to 81 degrees F. If the dough seems dry and rips, add a few drops of water and continue kneading. If the dough seems sticky or tacky, add more flour to achiever the stiffness required. The kneaded dough should feel satiny and pliable but not be tacky. 4. Immediately divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Form the pieces into rolls. 5. Cover the rolls with a damp towel and allow them to rest for approximately 20 minutes. 6. Line 2 sheet pans with baking parchment and mist lightly with spray oil. Proceed with shaping the bagels: Push a hole through the center of the roll with your thumb and stretch out the hole to 2½ inches in diameter, making sure that the resulting ring has a fairly even thickness all the way around. 7. Place each of the shaped pieces 2 inches apart on the pan. Mist the bagels very lightly with the spray oil and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let the pans sit at room temperature for 20 minutes. 8. Check to see if the bagels are ready to be retarded in the refrigerator by using the ""float test"". Fill a small bowl with cool or room temperature water. The bagels are ready to be retarded when they float within 10 seconds of being dropped into the water. Take one bagel and test it. If it floats, immediately return the tester bagel to the pan, pat it dry, cover the pan, and place it in the refrigerator overnight (it can stay in the refrigerator for up to 2 days). If the bagel does not float, return it to the pan and continue to proof the dough at room temperature, checking back every 10 to 20 minutes or so until a tester floats. The time needed to accomplish the float will vary, depending on the ambient temperature and the stiffness of the dough. 9. The following day (or when you are ready to bake the bagels), preheat the oven to 500 degrees F with the two racks set in the middle of the oven. Bring a large pot of water to a boil (the wider the better), and add the baking soda. Have a slotted spoon or skimmer nearby. 10. Remove the bagels from the refrigerator and gently drop them into the water, boiling only as many as comfortably fit (they should float within 10 seconds). After 1 minute flip them over and boil another minute. While the bagels are boiling, sprinkle the same parchment-lined sheet pans with cornmeal or semolina flour. Sprinkle the bagels with the shredded Asiago as soon as they come out of the water. 11. When all the bagels have been boiled and topped, place the pans on the two middle shelves in the oven. Bake for approximately 8 minutes, then rotate the pans, switching shelves and giving the pans a 180-degree rotation. (If you are only baking one pan at a time, keep it on the center shelf but still rotate 180 degrees.)

Continue to mix, bringing in all the flour – when the dough comes together and becomes too hard to mix with your fork, flour your hands and begin to pat it into a ball.Knead the dough by rolling it backwards and forwards, using your hands to stretch, pull and push the dough. Keep kneading for 10 minutes, or until you have a smooth, springy, soft dough.Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave in a warm place to to prove for 45 minutes, or until doubled in size.For the sauce, peel and finely slice the garlic, then pick the basil leaves and finely chop the stalks.Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan on a medium-low heat, add the garlic and basil stalks, then cook gently for a couple of minutes, or until the garlic is lightly golden, then add most of the basil leaves, the tomatoes, and a pinch of salt and pepper.Leave the sauce to tick away for around 20 minutes, or until smooth, breaking up the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. When the time’s up, taste, and season to perfection.To assemble the pizzas, divide the dough in half. Wrap one half in clingfilm and freeze for another day. With the remaining half, divide the dough into 4 equal balls.Flour each dough ball, then cover with clingfilm, and leave to rest for about 15 minutes – this will make them easier to roll it thinly.Dust a clean surface and the dough with a little flour or semolina, and roll it out into a rough circle, about ½cm thick.Tear off an appropriately sized piece of tin foil, rub it with olive oil, dust well with flour or semolina and place the pizza base on top. Continue doing the same with the remaining dough, dust with a little flour so you can pile them up. Cover with clingfilm and place in the fridge.When you're ready to cook them, preheat the oven to 250°C/500°F/gas 9.At this stage you can apply your topping: spread the tomato sauce over the base, spreading it out to the edges. Tear over the mozzarella and scatter with the remaining basil leaves. Drizzle with a tiny bit of olive oil and add a pinch of salt and pepper.If you can, cook the pizzas on a piece of granite in your conventional oven – if not, cook them one by one on pieces of tin foil directly on the bars of the oven shelf, towards the bottom of the oven (If you're going to cook your pizzas on the bars of the oven, make sure they're not too big – otherwise they'll be difficult to manoeuvre).

Add the chopped onions and cook until they become translucent, stirring occasionally. This step is crucial as it forms the base flavor of the goulash. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Then, remove the pot from the heat and stir in the sweet Hungarian paprika. This helps prevent the paprika from burning, which could cause a bitter taste. Add the diced beef shank or shin to the pot, stirring well to coat the meat with the paprika and onion mixture. Return the pot to the heat and cook the meat until it starts to brown slightly. Add the sliced carrots, bell peppers, dried marjoram, and caraway seeds to the pot. Stir everything together to combine the flavors. Pour in the beef stock, ensuring that the meat and vegetables are fully submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it simmer gently for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender. If you choose to use tomatoes, add them about halfway through the cooking time. Taste the goulash and adjust the seasoning with salt and black pepper as needed. Serve the goulash hot, traditionally with a side of fresh bread or small dumplings (csipetke). You can garnish with freshly chopped parsley if desired.

data/bronze/recipes/brendanmckenzie_recipes/european/french/croissants.source	croissants		Watch the video below and use the step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe before beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6 and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets. Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and begin to knead the dough. Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. (If you’re new to bread-baking, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rest. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rest. If not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test. Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video below, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14×10-inch rectangle. The dough isn’t extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Place the rolled out dough back onto the baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step. In this next step, you will be rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you, like I do in the video below. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn. If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn.I usually don’t have to. Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2ndand 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.(Up to 24 hours is ok.) At the end of the next step, you’ll need 2 baking sheets lined with silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1 prepared! Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8×20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room temperature (no warmer—I suggest keeping on the counter) for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants to be cold going into the oven. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Whisk the egg wash ingredients together.Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash. Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 375°F (190°C). Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool. Croissants taste best the same day they’re baked. Cover any leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator.

Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement - it should be half the width of the flattened dough. Place the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for 30 minutes. The butter layer should be firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the dough in the next step.

Roll the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat. The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator. Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of the dough over it. If the butter wasn't an exact 7×10-inch rectangle, use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers.

On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch rectangle. It's best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of the dough facing you. Use your fingers if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.

If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn.

2nd turn: Turn the dough so the short end is facing you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter. The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd and 3rd turn because it has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.

3rd turn: Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.

Long rest: Place the folded dough on the lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.

Shape the croissants: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an 8×20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. See photo above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles. You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8 inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers. Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest at room temperature for 1 hour, then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours. 

Preheat oven to 204°C.

Egg wash: Whisk the egg wash ingredients together. Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with egg wash.

Bake the croissants: Bake until croissants are golden brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to 190°C.

Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool."

Let this sit while you make the stir fry. In a mortar and pestle, pound the Thai chilies into a fine paste. Add the garlic and the chopped mild chilies and pound into just a rough paste. Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat, adding about 1 tablespoon of the oil if your beef is lean. Once the wok is very hot, add the beef and spread it out. Sear the beef without moving it until the underside is browned. Toss the beef, and notice how the beef will start to release quite a bit of liquid  - keep stirring until all of this liquid has evaporated, and the beef starts to sizzle in its own fat. Once the beef is sizzling, allow it to cook without stirring for 15-20 seconds to brown the beef further and develop flavour, then toss, and repeat the browning 1-2 more times. Turn the heat down to medium, push the beef to one side of the pan, and if there isn’t much fat in the pan, add a little bit more oil just so there’s enough to saute the garlic. Add the garlic and chili paste and sauté in the oil for 30 seconds until aromatic and the garlic starts to turn golden, and then toss it with the beef. Turn the heat up to high and add about half of the stock or water, fish sauce, sugar, and black pepper; toss to mix well.

Taste and adjust the seasoning with more sugar or fish sauce as needed, and add a little more water or stock if it feels too dry. Set this aside while you fry the eggs. To fry the eggs Thai-style, I recommend frying them 1 at a time to prevent them from sticking to each other. There are 2 options for frying eggs:For crispy whites and semi-set yolk: Add about ¼ inch of frying oil to a small nonstick frying pan and put it over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the egg and allow the egg white to bubble. Use a spoon to occasionally baste the top of the egg with oil to cook the yolk. Once the whites are crispy and browned around the edges and the yolk is set to your liking, you can remove it from the pan.For eggs with crispy whites and runny yolk: Separate the egg white and the egg yolk. Add about ¼ inch of frying oil to a small nonstick frying pan and put it over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the egg white and let it fry until the edges start to turn brown.  Use your spatula to push the middle of the white down to make an indent for the yolk to sit in. Once the egg white is browned around the edges, carefully place the yolk into the indentation, and use a spoon to baste some oil around the edges of the egg yolk to help it stick to the egg white. Remove from the pan and allow to drain. To serve, put jasmine rice on a plate, spoon the pad kra pao over half of the rice, and top everything with the fried egg.

Line a 9-inch square baking pan (I love this one and this one) with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to easily lift the bars out of the pan. Set aside. Whisk the flour, 1 cup (85g) oats, brown sugar, baking powder, lemon zest, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the melted butter and vanilla, and stir until the mixture resembles moist crumbly sand and no dry spots remain. You will have a little more than 3 cups of crust mixture, or about 520g. Press 2/3 of the mixture (about 2 cups/345g—doesn’t have to be exact) into the prepared baking pan. Press it into the pan (with your hands, a large spoon or spatula, or the bottom of a measuring cup) to form a crust. Bake for 10 minutes, and then remove from the oven to slightly cool. Place the cornstarch in a small bowl and set aside, within reach of the stove. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, combine the cherries, sugar, and lemon juice. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cherries begin to release their juices—about 4 to 6 minutes. While the cherries continue to cook, carefully remove a couple of spoonfuls of the juice from the saucepan and add to the bowl of cornstarch. Using a fork, mix the cornstarch and cherry juice together until the cornstarch is dissolved. Stir this mixture into the filling, then bring to a boil and cook, stirring occasionally, until the filling has thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the almond extract. Pour/spread the filling over the warm crust. Stir 2 Tablespoons oats into the remaining crumble mixture, then sprinkle it all over the filling, and lightly press it down with the back of a large spoon or flat spatula. Bake for about 40–50 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick comes out *mostly* clean (with a few jammy cherry specks!). Mine take about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack. After about 1 hour, you can place the whole pan in the refrigerator to help speed things up. Whisk the icing ingredients together. Add more milk to thin out, if desired. Drizzle over cooled bars.

Drop in the egg yolk and beat for 1 minute. Add the flour all at once. Mix on low speed just until the flour has disappeared (or do this last little bit by hand with a flexible spatula).

Line 2–3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2–2.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above. Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1–2-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it’s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1–2-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar. Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Bake the chilled cookies for 12–15 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes. Keep your eye on them. They’re done when the edges lightly brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. You can melt the chocolate in adouble boiler or the microwave. If using the microwave: place the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl.

Tips from our Bakers: Flavor to taste: classic pizzelle are often flavored with anise extract or anise seed. Butter-rum, lemon, or rum flavors are also delicious. Simply add extract to the batter to taste. Start with 1/4 teaspoon; amounts will vary a lot, depending on the strength of the extract you choose.

One reader suggests the best way to grease your pizzelle iron is to dip a towel in vegetable oil, and wipe it all over the iron's interior plates. This helps avoid the sticky residue you may get from spraying the iron with non-stick spray."

Add the Flour and M&M's - Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in the flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in ¾ cup M&M candies and chocolate chips. Give the dough a final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain. Chill the Dough - Transfer the mixing bowl to the refrigerator for 30 minutes or the freezer for 15 minutes. Chill until the dough firms up, around 65 to 70ºF (18 to 21ºC). The dough should not feel overly sticky. Preheat the Oven - Adjust the oven rack to the middle position. Heat to 375°F (191ºC).

FOR THE COOKIES:  Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Pulse peanuts in food processor until finely chopped, about 8 pulses. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, milk, and egg together in second bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture with rubber spatula until combined. Stir in peanuts until evenly distributed. Using . scoop or tablespoon measure, place 12 mounds, evenly spaced, on each prepared baking sheet. Using damp hand, flatten mounds until 2 inches in diameter. Bake until deep golden brown and firm to touch, 15 to 18 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Let cookies cool on sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack and let cool completely, about 30 minutes. Repeat portioning and baking remaining dough. FOR THE FILLING: Microwave peanut butter and butter until butter is melted and warm, about 40 seconds. Using rubber spatula, stir in confectioners’ sugar until combined.

Place second cookie on top of filling, right side up, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Allow filling to set for 1 hour before serving. Assembled cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days. Since we knew that the starch granules in flour mute the flavor of peanut butter we briefly turned our attention to an Internet sensation flourless peanut butter cookies made with just peanut butter sugar egg and sometimes a bit of baking soda. Indeed when we tried a sample batch of our cookies sans flour they tasted super peanut-y and baked up looking much like traditional peanut butter cookies. Why didnt these flourless cookies melt right off of the cookie sheet Because peanut butter contains approximately  percent carbohydrates and  percent protein components that absorb moisture and harden into a stable network in the heat of the oven. But without the sturdier structure that only starch from wheat flour can provide these cookies fell apart in our hands before we could even take a bite.  Many recipes for peanut butter sandwich cookies disappoint with soft dull-tasting cookies and overly sweet fillings.

Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup, if desired. To prepare your carrots, peel them and then cut them on the diagonal so each piece is about ½″ thick at the widest part (see photos). Place the carrots on the baking sheet. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and ½ teaspoon of the salt. Toss until the carrots are lightly coated in oil and seasonings. Arrange them in a single layer. Roast the carrots until they’re caramelized on the edges and easily pierced through by a fork, 25 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway. (Heirloom carrot varieties will roast in as little as 25 minutes, but regular carrots are more dense and typically require 35 to 40 minutes.) Once the carrots are almost done roasting, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic, coriander and cumin (if following a variation, see recipe notes for additions). Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.Pour in the vegetable broth and water, while scraping up any browned bits on the bottom with a wooden spoon or sturdy silicone spatula. Add the roasted carrots to the pot when they are out of the oven. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for 15 minutes, to give the flavors time to meld. Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, working in batches if necessary. (Do not fill past the maximum fill line or the soup could overflow!) Add the butter, lemon juice (or lime, if following the Thai variation), and several twists of black pepper. Blend until completely smooth. Add additional salt and pepper if necessary, to taste.

Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup, if desired.

To prepare your @carrots{2%lb}, peel them and then cut them on the diagonal so each piece is about ½″ thick at the widest part (see photos).

Place the carrots on the #baking sheet{}. Add 2 tablespoons @olive oil{3%Tbsp} and ½ teaspoon of the @salt{0.75%tsp}. Toss until the carrots are lightly coated in oil and seasonings. Arrange them in a single layer.

Roast the carrots until they’re caramelized on the edges and easily pierced through by a fork, 25 to ~{40%minutes}, tossing halfway. (Heirloom carrot varieties will roast in as little as 25 minutes, but regular carrots are more dense and typically require 35 to 40 minutes.)

Once the carrots are almost done roasting, in a #Dutch oven or soup pot{}, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the @yellow onion{1%medium} and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent, 5 to ~{7%minutes}.

Add the @garlic{2%cloves}, @coriander{0.5%tsp} and @cumin{0.25%tsp} (if following a variation, see recipe notes for additions). Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds to ~{1%minute}. Pour in the @vegetable broth{4%cup} and @water{2%cup}, while scraping up any browned bits on the bottom with a #wooden spoon or sturdy silicone spatula{}.

Add the roasted carrots to the pot when they are out of the oven. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook for ~{15%minutes}, to give the flavors time to meld.

Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes. Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a #blender{}, working in batches if necessary. (Do not fill past the maximum fill line or the soup could overflow!)

Add the @butter{1.5%Tbsp}, @lemon juice{1.5%tsp} (or lime, if following the Thai variation), and several twists of @black pepper{}. Blend until completely smooth. Add additional salt and pepper if necessary, to taste. Add another tablespoon of butter if you’d like more richness, or a little more lemon juice if it needs more zing. Blend again, and serve.

Prepare vine tomatoes by slicing them in half and placing them in a roasting tray. Add sliced red onion and garlic to the tray. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and sugar. Splash a bit of aged balsamic vinegar on top. Roast in the oven for 20-25 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and caramelized. In a dry pan, toast pine nuts until fragrant. In a pestle and mortar, combine sun-dried tomatoes, toasted pine nuts, grated Parmesan cheese, and extra virgin olive oil to form a pesto. Remove tomatoes from the oven and pour vegetable or chicken stock over them, just enough to come halfway up the tomatoes. Break up tomatoes with a spoon and simmer for 3-4 minutes. Add cream if a creamier texture is desired. Use a stick blender to blend the soup until smooth. Make a roux with butter and flour. Add stout beer gradually, stirring to a smooth consistency. Mix in Dijon mustard, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and grated cheese until melted and combined. Toast both sides of a slice of rustic bread. Spread the cheesy mixture over the toast and place under the grill until bubbly and browned. Pour the soup into bowls, drizzle with the sun-dried tomato pesto, and garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve the soup alongside slices of Welsh rarebit	2 cloves garlic,2 medium red onions,1 tsp cayenne pepper,some  olive oil,1 pinch salt,1 pinch pepper,1 tsp brown sugar,1 tsp balsamic vinegar,3.5 lbs tomatoes,1 qt vegetable stock,4 oz heavy cream,3 Tbsp pine nuts,3 oz sun-dried tomatoes,1 pinch pepper,2 oz Parmesan,1 dash olive oil,1 dash tomato oil	"Soup: Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Beat the milk, warm water and egg together in a separate bowl and pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon to bring the ingredients together, then turn out the mixture onto the work surface and knead it with a dough scraper for 5 minutes, until you have a slightly sticky dough. Wrap the dough and chill it for 1 hour.  Place the remaining block of chilled butter between 2 sheets of baking paper and flatten it out with a rolling pin to a rectangle measuring about 33 x 19cm.  Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the chilled dough to a rectangle about 1cm thick and measuring 50 x 20cm. With a short end of the dough closest to you, lay the butter on top of the dough, so that it covers the bottom two thirds. Make sure that it is positioned neatly and almost reaches the sides.  Fold the exposed dough at the top (without the butter) down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom third of the dough (with butter) up over the dough – you will now have a sandwich of 2 layers of butter and 3 layers of dough. Pinch together the edges of the dough lightly to seal in the butter and turn the dough/butter parcel 90 degrees, so the long seam is on the left-hand side.

Use a sturdy spoon, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough	540 g bread flour,1 Tbsp granulated sugar,2.25 tsp instant yeast,2.5 tsp salt,379 g lukewarm (90-110°F) water,some  vegetable oil or cooking spray,some  cornmeal	"Stir together 540 g to 600 g @bread flour{540%g}, @granulated sugar{1%Tbsp}, @instant yeast{2.25%tsp}, @salt{2.5%tsp}, and @lukewarm (90-110°F) water{379%g} in a #large bowl{}, starting with 540 g of the flour. Use a #sturdy spoon{}, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough.

If you’re kneading the dough by hand, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, using some of the additional 1/2 cup of flour called for. Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you, then press it away from you with the heels of your hands. Rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this fold-press-rotate process with a rhythmic, rocking motion for about ~{6%minutes}. When fully kneaded, the dough will be bouncy and smooth.

If you’re using your stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough at medium speed for about 7 minutes, until it’s smooth, elastic, and feels a bit bouncy. If the dough doesn’t form a ball that clears the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in just enough of the additional flour to make this happen.

Place the dough in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with @vegetable oil or cooking spray{}; the bowl you started with is fine. Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} or another airtight cover, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it's doubled in size, about 1 to ~{2%hours}. If your kitchen is particularly cold (below 65°F), place the bowl of dough in your turned-off oven with the oven light on.

Gently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6” x 8” oval.

Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.

Place the loaves, seam-side down, on a #baking sheet{} (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with @cornmeal{}; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.

Let the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for ~{45%minutes}. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.

For extra-crusty crust and a great rise, add steam to your oven as follows: While the oven is preheating, place an empty #cast-iron frying pan{} on the lowest rack. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in the microwave or on the stovetop.

When your bread is risen, use a #sieve{} to dust the loaves with a thin coat of flour. Then make three or four 1/2” deep diagonal slashes in each loaf; these slashes will help the bread rise evenly as it bakes. Place the bread in the oven and pour the boiling water into the frying pan below. Quickly shut the oven door. Wear good oven mitts during this process to shield your hands and arms from the steam.

Bake the bread for 20 to ~{25%minutes}, until the crust is golden brown and a loaf sounds hollow to the touch when you tap it on the bottom. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer.

Turn the oven off, crack the door open, and allow the bread to remain inside for an additional ~{5%minutes}; this helps keep the crust crisp. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack. It’s best not to cut into the bread until it’s cooled down a bit; cutting into hot bread can negatively affect its texture.

Store the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days. Freeze for longer storage."

In a #large bowl{} or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together the @bread flour{120%g}, @kosher salt{1/4%tsp}, @instant yeast{1/16%tsp}, and @cool water{75%g} to make a shaggy dough, then use your hand to knead gently until thoroughly combined. (This may take about a minute; it's quite stiff.) Cover the bowl and let the starter rest at room temperature for 4 to ~{14%hours}; it should expand.

To make the dough: Add

all the starter, @room temperature water{170%g}, @barley malt syrup{14%g} or @dark brown sugar (alternative){13%g}, @instant yeast{3/4%tsp}, @salt{8%g}, @bread flour{300%g} in the order listed to the bowl with the starter. Mix to bring the dough together, by hand or at low speed of a #stand mixer{} with the dough hook attachment. Next, knead the stiff dough until it’s supple and elastic. This will take up to ~{15%minutes} by hand or 8 to 10 minutes at medium-low speed with a mixer.

Place the dough in a #lightly greased bowl{} and let it rest, covered with a #reusable cover or plastic wrap{}, until it doubles in bulk. This will take about 2 to ~{2.5%hours} depending on the warmth of your kitchen.

Turn the dough out onto a clean surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into eight equal pieces.

To preshape the dough: Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the edges into the center. Pinch to seal and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

Starting with the first piece of dough you shaped, place it seam-side down on an unfloured surface. Use your cupped fingers and palm to roll the dough into a tight ball, moving your hand in a circular motion. The dough should stick slightly to the surface in order to create tension to yield a smooth exterior. If the dough is unmanageably sticky, add a very light dusting of flour; if the dough slides around on the surface without tightening, use a damp towel to clean and moisten the surface and try again.

Once shaped into a tight ball, place the dough onto a lightly floured surface and repeat with the remaining pieces of dough.

Cover the preshaped dough and allow it to rest for 10 to ~{15%minutes}.

Line a #baking sheet{} with #parchment{} and lightly grease the parchment; or sprinkle the parchment lightly with cornmeal, semolina, or farina, to prevent the bagels from sticking.

To shape the bagels: Working with one piece of dough at a time, use your finger to poke a hole through the center. Gently rotate the dough to expand the hole to 2"" to 3"" in diameter, forming a ring shape. Place the shaped bagel onto the prepared baking sheet. The hole will close up a bit; that’s OK.

Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough. Place the bagels on the baking sheet in a 3-2-3 arrangement to allow them to fit nicely on one pan.

Cover the bagels with a reusable cover or lightly greased plastic wrap and let them rest until they feel slightly puffy to the touch, about ~{30%minutes}.

While the bagels are resting, preheat the oven to 450°F. Combine the @water{1808%g} and @barley malt syrup or honey{42%g} in a wide, #shallow pot{}; the water should be at least 1.25"" deep. Bring the mixture to a boil.

To boil the bagels: Add bagels to the water two or three at a time to avoid crowding. Boil for ~{60%seconds}, then use a #dough whisk or slotted spoon{} to turn the bagels over. Boil for another ~{60%seconds} before removing from the water and placing on the prepared pan.

If adding a topping, such as @Everything bagel topping (optional){47%g}, brush each bagel with the @egg{1} and @water{1%Tbsp} (egg wash) and dip into a bowl of your desired topping before transferring back to the pan.

Bake the bagels until golden brown, 18 to ~{22%minutes}. Rotate the pan (front to back, back to front) halfway through baking to ensure even browning.

Remove the bagels from the oven and transfer them to a #cooling rack{} to cool.

Storage information: Prepared bagel sandwiches can be stored, well-wrapped in foil, in the refrigerator for up to two days or in the freezer for up to a month. (See “tips,” below, for reheating instructions.) Bagels that aren’t made into sandwiches can be stored, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days, or frozen for longer storage.

Tip: To bake your bagels first thing in the morning: Prepare the dough up through step 5 (complete the kneading process) and allow it to rise for just 1 hour. Continue following the recipe through step 12 (shaping the bagels). Immediately place the baking sheet with the prepared bagels, covered, into the refrigerator overnight (8 to 12 hours). The next morning, continue the recipe as written starting at step 14 (preheating the oven). Leave the bagels in the refrigerator until the water bath is boiling and the oven is preheated."

Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a #lightly greased bowl{}, covered, for 1 to ~{1.5%hours}, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.

Gently deflate the dough and divide it into four equal pieces; if you have a scale each piece will weigh between 170 g and 175 g.

Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for ~{15%minutes}; or for up to 1 hour, if that works better with your schedule.

Flatten each piece of dough into a 5"" x 8"" rectangle, then fold the short ends in towards one another like a letter. Flatten the folded pieces into rectangles again (this time about 3"" x 6"") and, starting with a short end, roll them each into a 4"" log.

Place the logs in a row of four — seam side down and side by side — in a lightly greased #9"" x 5"" loaf pan{}.

Cover the loaf and allow it to rest/rise for 40 to ~{50%minutes}, until puffy.

Cover the container and set a 30-minute timer., To fold the dough: After 30 minutes, perform a bowl fold: Lift the side of the dough, stretching upward, then press it down into the middle. Repeat this motion, working around the dough, for a total of 8 to 12 stretches and folds. After the last fold, turn the dough over so that it’s seam-side down in the container. Cover and let it rest for 30 more minutes., After the rest, mark the height of the dough in the container with a large rubber band or a piece of tape. Place the dough in the refrigerator to rise for 8 to 24 hours., After the cold rise, allow the dough to warm slightly at room temperature, anywhere between 1 and 2 hours. By this point, the dough should have risen in volume 1 1/2 to 2 times., To preshape the baguettes: Lightly sprinkle the surface of the dough in the container with whole wheat flour, then use a bowl scraper to release the sides of the dough so that it can turn out without pulling or tearing. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly flour the top, then divide it into 3 equal pieces (about 250g each)., Use lightly floured hands to pat each piece of dough into a rough 6"" square, pressing gently to pop any air bubbles. Starting with the first piece of dough you handled, shape it into a tube: Fold in the left side and the right side to meet in the middle then press to gently seal. Starting at the top, fold the rectangle towards yourself in 3 motions, pressing gently after each fold, to create a cylinder with the seam-side down. The entire time you work, apply flour as needed to make sure the dough is moving easily on the work surface, with no wet bits threatening to stick. Repeat this process with the other 2 pieces of dough. Cover the preshaped dough and let them rest for 15 minutes., To shape the baguettes: Move a piece of preshaped dough to the center of the lightly floured surface and stretch it gently to elongate on the east/west axis, then pat it lightly to remove any bubbles. Next, fold the dough from the top down 2/3 of the way and pat to gently seal. Rotate the dough 180° and again fold toward you to bring the dough 2/3 of the way down; pat gently to seal. Last, make a gentle east/west divot in the middle of the dough and then fold the top of the dough down to the bottom edge and press to seal with the heel of your hand., With the seam-side down, place a single palm in the middle of the dough and roll it gently back and forth. With light pressure, a depression will form, turning the log into a dog bone shape. Next, add your second hand and roll the dough side to side, pushing it back and forth so that it travels across the work surface; slowly move your hands apart and toward the tips of the baguette, adding pressure so that the ends taper. If the dough is resistant, go back to the middle and take another pass. Aim for your baguettes to be 16"" to 18"" in length so that they fit comfortably on your baking stone or steel (use a half-sheet of parchment as your guide)., Once shaped, place the baguette seam-side up onto a baker’s couche or stiff cotton dish towel that’s been lightly dusted with whole wheat flour. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough., Cover the baguettes and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy. The loaves should look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but they will not have doubled in size. This should take about 45 to 60 minutes at room temperature (about 68°F); it could take as few as 30 minutes in a warm environment. Meanwhile, prepare your oven for baking., While the dough rises, preheat the oven to 500°F with a cast iron pan on the bottom of the oven, or on the lowest rack. (If you can fit two cast iron pans, even better; alternatively, use a 9"" x 13"" pan that you are comfortable reserving for this purpose; it may warp.) Place a baking steel or stone on the middle rack above the pans to preheat., Gently roll the proofed baguettes onto a transfer peel so that they're seam-side down, then nudge them onto a piece of parchment, still seam-side down. (If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment placed on an inverted baking sheet.) For the easiest scoring, chill the baguettes for 10 minutes in the refrigerator., Using a baker's lame held at about a 30° to 45° angle, make 1, 3, or 5 long lengthwise cuts in each baguette., To bake the baguettes: Load the baguettes into the oven. Use a baker’s peel, a rimless baking sheet, or an inverted baking sheet to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot steel or stone. Carefully pour about 1 cup of water into the cast iron pan(s) and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise and give them a lovely, shiny crust., Immediately reduce the oven temperature to 475°F., Bake the baguettes for 24 to 28 minutes, or until they're very deep golden brown. For the crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, prop the door open about 2"", and let the baguettes dry out for an additional 10 minutes. Remove baguettes from the oven and cool them on a rack. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature., Storage information: These overnight baguettes are best eaten fresh.

Divide the dough in half. Working with one piece at a time,transfer the dough to a well-floured surface.

Stretch and fold it, as follows: Holding onto the dough at both ends, pull one end away from the other, then fold it back onto itself. Repeat on the other side so that all four corners of the dough have been stretched and folded.

Next,pull the ends of the dough toward the middle, then turn it over. Using your fingers, pull the dough under itself to make a smooth, round ball with the seams tucked into the bottom. Repeat with the other piece of dough.Place each ball seam-side down into a floured #bowl{}.

Cover the bowls and allow the dough to proof (rise) for ~{45%minutes} to an hour, while your oven preheats.

Working with one piece at a time, transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface and dust the top with flour. Use your fingertips to gently depress the surface, being careful not to touch the outer edge of the crust; you want it to remain thick.

Lift up the crust and use your knuckles to gently stretch it into a circle about 10"" to 12"" in diameter. Move it to a well-floured #pizza peel{} or floured sheet of parchment. If you're using parchment, trim the excess around the dough to prevent it from burning.

Lightly sauce the dough, then add your toppings of choice. For special toppings easy to prepare in advance see ""tips,"" below.

Turn on the top broiler in your preheated oven and transfer the pie to the steel or stone. Be sure there's at least 8"" of space between the surface of the pizza and the broiler.If you have an oven with the broiler on the bottom (usually in the bottom compartment of the oven), or on top in a smaller, separate compartment, make sure there's at least 8"" between the broiler and the cooking surface. If there isn't, don't use the broiler. Your pizza will still be great without being broiled, though it may take a few more minutes to bake., Gently slide the pizza (or pizza and parchment) onto the steel or stone. Bake the pizza for approximately ~{6%minutes} on the steel (or ~{7%minutes} on the stone), until bubbly and charred on the edges. Remove the pizza from the oven and top it with freshly grated Parmesan, if desired., Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings.

Tip: Substitute an equal amount of all-purpose flour for a slightly less chewy crust. No other changes are necessary.

Tip: To make the ""Veg Vinaigrette Pizza"": Top your pie with red sauce and add a sprinkle of grated mozzarella followed by roasted butternut squash or roasted sweet potato. Bake as directed. Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with your favorite vinaigrette. When the vinaigrette hits the hot surface it blooms — i.e., becomes super aromatic. Top with quick-pickled red onions (or other pickled items in your fridge, like capers) or radishes for color, and finish with a sprinkle of feta or crumbled blue cheese.

Tip: To make the ""Smoky-Sweet Pizza"": Top your pie with a thin layer of BBQ sauce and sprinkle with grated mozzarella. Add sliced pears, bacon that’s been cooked about halfway (pliable, not crispy), and thinly sliced scallions that have been flash-fried in oil. Bake the pizza as directed. To finish, drizzle with BBQ sauce from a squirt bottle, or BBQ sauce mixed with tomato sauce (roughly equal measures of each).

Tip: The maximum temperature rating for most parchment paper is below 500°F, and at temperatures between 450°F and 500°F parchment’s exposed edges begin to char. To be safe, keep a close eye on anything being cooked at temperatures above 450°F (especially anything on an upper rack). Burned edges can also be minimized by trimming away excess parchment before baking."

In a large bowl, combine the starter ingredients	113 g water,0.062 tsp instant yeast,120 g all-purpose flour,255 g water,1.5 tsp instant yeast,420 g all-purpose flour,2 tsp salt	"Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess. In a #large bowl{}, combine the starter ingredients.

To make the starter: Mix @water{113%g}, @instant yeast{1/16%tsp}, and @all-purpose flour{120%g} together to make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have expanded and become bubbly.

To make the dough: Mix and knead @water{255%g}, starter, @instant yeast{1.5%tsp}, @all-purpose flour{420%g}, and @salt{2%tsp} together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.

Place the dough in a lightly greased #medium-sized bowl{}, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for ~{45%minutes}. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three equal pieces.

Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to ~{1%hour}, if that works better with your schedule.

Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.

Turn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.

With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16"" log. Your goal is a 15"" baguette, so 16"" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical ""pointy"" end.

Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy (""marshmallow-y"" is the term we use in our baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68°F).

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a #cast iron pan{} on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.

If your baguettes have risen in a #dish towel or couche{}, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece of #parchment{}, seam-side down. If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment (seam-side down) and then place the parchment on a baking sheet.

Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.

Load the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust.

Bake the baguettes - on the pan, or on a stone - for 24 to ~{28%minutes}, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2"", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.

Storage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage. Thaw and reheat just before serving."

Using slotted spoon, transfer caper mixture to paper towel–lined plate; set aside. Leave oil in skillet and return skillet to medium heat. Add panko, salt, and pepper to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until panko is golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer panko to medium bowl. Stir in parsley, lemon zest, and reserved caper mixture. FOR THE PASTA: Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. While water is coming to boil, heat oil, garlic, and anchovies in large saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until anchovies break down and garlic is lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, salt, sugar, and pepper flakes to saucepan and stir to combine. Cover and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt to boiling water. Cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve ½ cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot. Off heat, add butter and tomato mixture to pasta and stir gently until oil, butter, and tomato juices combine to form light sauce, about 15 seconds.

data/bronze/recipes/nicholaswilde_recipes/cook/italian/Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo.source	Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo		Cook the fettuccine according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Stir in the cream, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, egg yolks, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Editor's Tip: Be sure to choose a saucepan that will fit the sauce and the cooked fettuccine. Everything will be combined in the pan before serving. If you prefer a garlicky Alfredo sauce, feel free to add minced garlic or garlic powder in this step. Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F. Do not boil the sauce. Editor's Tip: An instant-read meat thermometer is useful for making Alfredo sauce with eggs. Monitoring the temperature is the best way to ensure the egg yolks won't get hot enough to scramble. Drain the fettuccine and add it to the saucepan with the Alfredo sauce and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. If you'd like, sprinkle parsley over the fettuccine Alfredo. Editor's Tip: After stirring the pasta, sauce and cheese, the thick sauce and cheese should cling to the pasta. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, let the pasta simmer in the sauce for a few minutes before serving	4 oz fettuccine,3 Tbsp butter,1 cup heavy whipping cream,0.25 cup Parmesan,0.25 cup Romano cheese,1  egg yolk,0.125 tsp salt,1 dash pepper,1 dash nutmeg,some  parsley (optional)	"To start, cook the @fettuccine{4%oz} according to the package instructions. While the pasta is cooking, you can prepare the Alfredo sauce.

In a #saucepan{}, melt @butter{3%Tbsp} over medium-low heat. Be sure to choose a saucepan that will fit all of your Alfredo sauce with the cooked fettuccine—everything will be combined in it.

Pour the cup of @heavy whipping cream{1%cup} into the pot, stirring to combine. While heavy whipping cream and heavy cream are typically used interchangeably for some cooks, they do contain a slight difference in milk fat content, so the consistency might be a bit different if you decide to substitute.

Once combined, sprinkle in 1/4 cup @Parmesan{1/4%cup} cheese, all the @Romano cheese{1/4%cup}, the lightly beaten @egg yolk{1}, @salt{1/8%tsp}, @pepper{1%dash} and @nutmeg{1%dash}. The extra dash of ground nutmeg elevates the flavor along with the usual salt and pepper combo, making the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce stand out among the rest.

Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F; do not bring to a boil.

Drain the cooked fettuccine pasta, then add it to the saucepan with the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce and the remaining Parmesan cheese. Stir together the pasta, sauce and cheese until fully combined. The thick sauce and extra cheese should cling to the pasta nicely. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, you can let the pasta simmer for a few minutes to thicken it up before serving.

If desired, sprinkle with @parsley (optional){}. Serve with a slice of garlic bread or, even better, a batch of Copycat Olive Garden Breadsticks."

You can substitute part-skim ricotta for the whole-milk ricotta. Frozen whole-leaf spinach is easiest to squeeze dry, but frozen chopped spinach will work. Squeezing the spinach should remove ½ to ⅔ cup of liquid; you should have ⅔ cup of finely chopped spinach. Our tomato-butter sauce isn't strictly canonical; if you'd prefer a more traditional accompaniment, substitute our   Simple Tomato Sauce   or browned butter and fresh sage. Serve with a simple salad. FOR THE GNUDI: Line rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. Spread ricotta in even layer over towels; set aside and let sit for 10 minutes. Place flour, Parmesan, panko, salt, pepper, and lemon zest in large bowl and stir to combine. Process spinach in food processor until finely chopped, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer spinach to bowl with flour mixture. Grasp paper towels and fold ricotta in half; peel back towels. Rotate sheet 90 degrees and repeat folding and peeling 2 more times to consolidate ricotta into smaller mass. Using paper towels as sling, transfer ricotta to bowl with spinach mixture. Discard paper towels but do not wash sheet. Add egg whites to bowl and mix gently until well combined. Transfer heaping teaspoons of dough to now-empty sheet (you should have 45 to 50 portions). Using your dry hands, gently roll each portion into 1-inch ball. FOR THE SAUCE: Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, swirling saucepan occasionally, until butter is very foamy and garlic is pale golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, add tomatoes and vinegar; cover and set aside. Bring 1 quart water to boil in Dutch oven. Add 1½ teaspoons salt. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer all gnudi to water. Return water to gentle simmer. Cook, adjusting heat to maintain gentle simmer, for 5 minutes, starting timer once water has returned to simmer (to confirm doneness, cut 1 dumpling in half; center should be firm). While gnudi simmer, add salt and pepper to sauce and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are warmed through and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Divide sauce evenly among 4 bowls. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, remove gnudi from pot, drain well, and transfer to bowls with sauce. Garnish with basil and extra Parmesan. Serve immediately. The two key components in gnudi greens usually spinach or chard and ricotta contain loads of water that must be removed so that the dough isnt too wet and sticky to handle or too loose to form cohesive dumplings.

Place @all-purpose flour{1/2%cup}, @Parmesan{1%oz}, @panko{1%Tbsp}, @salt{3/4%tsp}, @pepper{1/2%tsp}, and @lemon zest{1/4%tsp} in #large bowl{} and stir to combine. Process @frozen whole-leaf spinach{10%oz} in #food processor{} until finely chopped, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer spinach to bowl with flour mixture. Grasp paper towels and fold ricotta in half; peel back towels. Rotate sheet 90 degrees and repeat folding and peeling 2 more times to consolidate ricotta into smaller mass. Using paper towels as sling, transfer ricotta to bowl with spinach mixture. Discard paper towels but do not wash sheet. Add @egg whites{2%large} to bowl and mix gently until well combined.

Transfer heaping teaspoons of dough to now-empty sheet (you should have 45 to 50 portions). Using your dry hands, gently roll each portion into 1-inch ball.

FOR THE SAUCE: Melt @unsalted butter{4%Tbsp} in #small saucepan{} over medium heat. Add thinly sliced @garlic{3%cloves} and cook, swirling saucepan occasionally, until butter is very foamy and garlic is pale golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, add @cherry or grape tomatoes{12%oz} and @cider vinegar{2%tsp}; cover and set aside.

Bring 1 quart @water{1%qt} to boil in #Dutch oven{}. Add 1.5 teaspoons @salt{1.5%tsp}. Using #spider skimmer or slotted spoon{}, transfer all gnudi to water. Return water to gentle simmer. Cook, adjusting heat to maintain gentle simmer, for ~{5%minutes}, starting timer once water has returned to simmer (to confirm doneness, cut 1 dumpling in half; center should be firm).

While gnudi simmer, add @salt{1/4%tsp} and @pepper{1/4%tsp} to sauce and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are warmed through and slightly softened, about ~{2%minutes}. Divide sauce evenly among 4 #bowls{}. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, remove gnudi from pot, drain well, and transfer to bowls with sauce. Garnish with @basil{2%Tbsp} and extra Parmesan.

Set potatoes either on a wire rack set over a baking sheet, on a baking sheet lined with a layer of salt, or directly on the oven's racks. Bake until completely tender throughout when pierced with a fork, about 45 minutes. Transfer potatoes to a work surface. Using tongs to hold hot potatoes, slice each in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop potato flesh into a ricer or food mill fitted with the finest disk. Press potato flesh onto a clean work surface, spreading it into an even layer, and allow steam to escape for a few minutes. Drizzle egg yolks all over, if using. Scoop 1/2 cup flour into a fine-mesh sieve and tap to dust flour all over potatoes. Using a pastry blender or bench scraper, chop down repeatedly all over to cut flour and egg into potato. Using a bench scraper, gather up shaggy potato mass and pat into a loose ball. Press ball flat with hands, then fold in half using bench scraper and press down again. Scoop remaining 1/4 cup flour into sieve and dust all over potato dough. Continue to gently fold and press, just until a uniform dough comes together. (Make sure to simply fold and press down; avoid the smearing motion more commonly used when kneading bread.) Dust potato dough all over with flour and gently form into a log. Clean work area well and dust with fresh flour. Using bench scraper, slice off a roughly 1-inch-thick portion of dough and roll into a snake about 1/2 inch thick; use a light touch as you roll, trying to use your palms more than your fingers, and dusting as necessary with flour to prevent sticking. Using bench scraper, cut snake into 1-inch portions, trimming off uneven ends as necessary. Transfer gnocchi to a well-floured area or baking sheet and repeat with remaining dough.

Scrape vanilla bean seeds into pan, then add pod. Heat over medium just until mixture starts to bubble around the edge of the pan, 7 to 8 minutes (do not let boil). Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks with remaining sugar and the salt. Temper eggs: Use ladle to pour a small amount of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture, then whisk to combine. (This is called tempering and prevents the eggs from curdling.)

Continue to stir often, until about 75 percent of the marshmallows are melted.

Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir, smashing the marshmallows using a #rubber spatula{} or the back of a wooden spoon, until the marshmallows completely melt and become smooth.

Note: We recommend taking the marshmallows off the heat before they are completely melted, so you will not overheat the marshmallows. The residual heat from the melted marshmallows will heat the unmelted marshmallows slowly, allowing them to melt without getting too hot. When marshmallows are overheated, the sugar crystallizes, turning into hard candy. Overheated marshmallows will make your treats hard to bite into.

Pour the marshmallows over the cereal and toss to combine.

Note: We recommend pouring the marshmallows over the cereal instead of adding them to the pan. If the cereal is poured into the hot pan, the crisp rice may become soft if it gets too hot. Your treats may taste stale immediately after they are made because the cereal will be soft.

Once the cereal is mixed with the melted marshmallows, pour it into a well-buttered 9 x 13 pan.

GENTLY spread it into an even layer. Do not compress the mixture or your treats will be dense and hard.

Allow the treats to cool for at least ~{30%minutes} before cutting into rectangles or squares.

Notes

European-style salted butter contains more butterfat than American-style butter adding richness to the treats. Salted butter balances out the sweetness.

We recommend using Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallows. They have great texture and flavor. We found store-brand marshmallows to be stickier. If you use store-brand marshmallows, we recommend adding up to one additional cup of Rice Krispies Cereal.

Store your treats in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

Do NOT refrigerate your treats. They will become stale-tasting if stored in the fridge.

You can freeze the treats. Wrap them well, and freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, bring them to room temperature and let them sit, wrapped, for a few hours. Then unwrap and enjoy.

Do NOT overheat your marshmallows. This is key to making soft and chewy Rice Krispie Treats, not hard treats.

Do NOT compact the cereal treat mixture into your pan or you will end up with very dense, hard treats. Gently press the mixture into the pan."

Lay the pears in the pan, then cook in the sauce for 10 to ~{12%minutes}, tossing occasionally, until completely caramelized. Don’t worry about them burning – they won’t – but you want to caramelize them as much as possible. Splash in the @brandy{2%Tbsp} and let it flambé, then set the pears aside.

Heat oven to 200°C / fan 180°C (350°F) / gas 6. Roll the @all-butter puff pastry{500%g} out to the thickness of 3 mm (1/8 in). Using a #plate{} slightly larger than the top of the pan, cut out a circle, then press the edges of the circle of pastry to thin them out.

When the pears have cooled slightly, arrange them in the pan, cut side up, in a floral shape, with the pears around the edge pointing inwards. Rest the cinnamon stick on the top in the center, with the cardamom pods scattered around.

Drape the pastry over the pears, then tuck the edges down the pan sides and under the fruit (see Gordon’s guide). Pierce the pastry a few times, then bake for ~{15%minutes}. If a lot of juice bubbles up the side of the pan, pour it off at this stage (see guide). Reduce oven to 180°C / fan 160°C (325°F) / gas 4 and bake for ~{15%minutes} more until the pastry is golden. Leave the tart to stand for ~{10%minutes}, then invert it carefully onto a serving dish."

Rub in the chilled butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add enough cold water to form a dough (about 6 tablespoons). On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle (approx. 15cm x 40cm).  Scatter half of the frozen butter over the bottom two-thirds of the dough. Fold down the top third and fold up the bottom third as if folding a letter. Turn the folded dough by 90 degrees and roll it out into a rectangle again. Repeat the process of adding the remaining frozen butter and fold as before.  Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes before using. For the crème pâtissière, pour the milk and cream into a pan. Add the vanilla paste and bring just to the boil, then take off the heat.  Whisk the egg yolks, caster sugar and cornflour together in a bowl. Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture whisking continuously.  Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously until the cream thickens. Cook over a low heat for 2 - 3 minutes to cook out the flour.   Remove from the heat and pass through a sieve into a bowl, then beat in the butter until smooth.  Pour out onto a shallow tray and cover the surface with cling film.  Leave to cool then chill in the fridge until set.   Heat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/425°F/Gas 7. Roll the pastry to a large rectangle measuring approx. 35cm x 45cm, about ½ cm thick. Place the pastry onto a baking sheet and chill for 10-15 minutes.  Place a baking sheet over the rolled-out pastry and bake for 20 - 30 minutes, until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oven, remove the top baking sheet and leave to cool.  For the icing, on a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, roll the white fondant into a 25 x 10 cm rectangle.  Break off small pieces of red and orange fondant and scatter them randomly over the white fondant.  Using a rolling pin roll the coloured fondant into the white fondant to create a smooth, patterned effect.  Cut out 4 rectangles of patterned fondant, each measuring 12cm x 5cm.  When the pastry has cooled, cut out 12 rectangles of pastry each measuring 12cm x 5cm.  Spoon the set crème pâtissière into a piping bag fitted with a ½ cm plain nozzle. To assemble, set aside 4 pastry rectangles. Place a raspberry in the corner of one of the pastry rectangles. Pipe a blob of crème pâtissière next to it. Sit a raspberry next to it and continue piping crème pâtissière with alternating raspberries until the pastry is covered. Repeat this process on the remaining 7 pastry rectangles.  Sit the rectangles on top of each other so you have 4 double-layered pastries, topped with raspberries and crème pâtissière.  To decorate, brush sugar syrup over the remaining 4 pastry rectangles and stick the fondant rectangles to the pastry. Place on top of the raspberries and crème pâtissière and lightly brush with sugar syrup, to glaze the fondant icing	300 ml whole milk,200 ml double cream,0.5 tsp vanilla paste,5 medium egg yolks,100 g caster sugar,40 g cornflour,100 g softened unsalted butter	"Pour the @whole milk{300%ml} and @double cream{200%ml} into a #pan{}.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the white sugar, brown sugar, and evaporated milk. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Once all is well mixed, insert a candy thermometer . Cook the candy, stirring occasionally, until the thermometer reads 240 F. Once the proper temperature is reached, remove the pan from the heat and drop the cubes of butter on top, without stirring. Allow the sugar mixture to sit for 1 minute. Add the vanilla extract and pecans. Begin to stir smoothly and constantly with a wooden spoon; the candy will begin to thicken and appear lighter in color. Continue to stir until the candy starts to hold its shape. It should still be easy to stir, but don't overdo it, as pralines quickly go from fluid to rock-solid. Once the confection has a lighter opaque-brown color and is holding its shape, work quicky and drop small spoonfuls of the candy onto the prepared baking sheet.

Once the dough has chilled, flour the surface and roll out the dough with sharp taps up and down the dough, rather than rolling, flouring the surface more if necessary. Continue to tap the dough up and down until it measures 30cm by 10cm.  Brush off any excess flour and fold the bottom third up and the top third down and turn so the dough looks like a closed book. Roll out again to the same size and repeat the fold before freezing again for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, start making the crème diplomat by making a crème patisserie. Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and flours until well combined and then heat the milk until just before simmering. Add 5 tbsp of milk to the egg mixture and whisk together to combine. Gradually add in the remaining milk and whisk until smooth. Place back in the pan and then bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly until thickened. Once thickened, remove from the heat and then transfer into a bowl and allow to cool completely.  Continue with the pastry and do two more rolls and folds, rolling and folding once more if the butter is still a little streaked. Rewrap in the clingfilm and allow to freeze for 10 more minutes.

You can follow my recipe for an all butter flaky pie crust, use your favorite recipe, or a store-bought crust. To make the tart cherry pie filling: add frozen tart cherries, sugar, cornstarch, flour and almond extract to a large pot and place over medium heat. After 5 minutes or so, the cherries will thaw, begin to break down and the sugar will melt. Stir frequently during this time. Add in butter and amaretto and continue to stir. After another 5-10 or so minutes, the mixture will begin to thicken and start to bubble along the edges. Once the filling begins to stick slightly to the back of your spoon, remove it from the heat and set aside to cool off. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. While your oven preheats, make the dutch crumble topping: in a medium bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar and oats. Add in the melted butter and stir together with a fork until it begins to form into crumbles and resembles clumpy wet sand. You may need to use your hands/fingers to form into nice crumbles. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 5 minutes or until ready to use. Remove pie pan with pie crust from the refrigerator and place pie pan onto a large baking sheet. I do this to avoid any spillage that may happen as the pie filling bubbles and bakes. Pour cooled tart cherry pie filling into the crust, then top filling with the dutch crumble topping. Bake for 1 hour-1 hour 15 minutes or until the filling is very bubbly and the crumble is slightly golden brown. Check pie after 30 minutes to make sure the crust isn’t burning. If it is getting too golden brown, simply cover pie edges with foil or pie shield. Allow pie to cool on a wire rack until completely cooled before cutting into it (this is annoying, but if you cut into it before then the pie filling won't be set). The longer the pie rests, the easier it is to serve! Can be made a few days ahead of time. Pie is best served at room temp or just slightly warm. Serves 9. Great with vanilla bean ice cream.

For about 35 mini cupcakes, bake for about 11–13 minutes, same oven temperature. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting. When the cupcakes are nearly cool, melt the white chocolate for the frosting: Place chopped white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl (I usually use a glass liquid measuring cup), and microwave in 20-second increments, stirring after every 20 seconds until completely smooth. Set it aside to cool at room temperature for 20 minutes. (Be sure the melted white chocolate has cooled for 20 minutes, so it’s still melted but not scorching hot, which would melt the butter.) Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup. Set aside. In a medium bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed for 1 minute. Switch the mixer to low speed and slowly add the confectioners’ sugar and strawberry powder. Stir the cooled white chocolate so that it is smooth, and then add it to the butter/sugar mixture. Switch the mixer to medium speed and beat for 2 minutes until combined and creamy. Add the cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Beat for 1 minute until combined. Taste.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt on medium-high speed until pale and very fluffy, stopping once during mixing to scrape down the paddle and bowl, 6 to 8 minutes total. (You might think it’s done before that time, but keep going all the way.)  Scrape down the paddle and sides of the bowl. On medium-high speed, beat in the eggs and yolk one at a time, scraping down the paddle and the bowl after each addition. The batter should look very fluffy, creamy, and emulsified (if not, your eggs or butter may have been not at room temperature—let the mixture come to room temperature then try mixing it again).  Scrape down the paddle and sides of the bowl. In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and vanilla until lump-free and totally smooth.  Add half of the sour cream and mix on medium-low until just incorporated, about 15 seconds. Add half of the flour and mix until just incorporated, about 15 seconds. Repeat with the remaining sour cream and flour. Using a flexible rubber spatula, scrape down the paddle and the bowl and mix the batter a few times to make sure everything is evenly combined.  Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and roughly level the batter with the spatula. With a butter knife or offset spatula, swirl the knife through the batter to make sure it is evenly distributed into the pan with no big air pockets and give the pan a few swift taps against the counter. Wet a butter knife and use it to slice down the center of the loaf cake (this ensures an even crack right down the middle of the cake).  Bake until the crust is deeply browned, the loaf rises and splits, and the cake feels firm and set when you gently press the top, 60 to 70 minutes.

Lightly grease two 8” x 2” or 9” x 2” round cake pans; for extra protection against sticking, line the bottom of the pans with parchment rounds (you can cut these yourself or use precut 8” or 9” rounds), and grease the parchment. If your 8” pans aren’t at least 2” deep, use 9” pans.

Weigh your @all-purpose flour{240%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

In a #small bowl{}, combine the flour, @salt{1.25%tsp}, and @baking powder{2%tsp}. Set aside.

In a #large mixing bowl{}, either using an #electric hand mixer or stand mixer{} with whisk attachment, beat the @eggs{4%large}, @granulated sugar{2%cups}, @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, and @almond extract (optional){1/8%tsp}, until thickened and light gold in color, about ~{2%minutes} at medium-high speed. If your stand mixer doesn’t have a whisk attachment, beat for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. The batter should fall in thick ribbons from the beaters, whisk, or paddle.

Add the dry ingredients to the mixture in the bowl and mix — by hand or on low speed of a mixer — just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix again briefly, to fully incorporate any residual flour or sticky bits.

In a saucepan set over medium heat or in the microwave, bring the @whole milk{1%cup} just to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the @unsalted butter{57%g} and @vegetable oil{1/3%cup}, stirring by hand until the butter has melted.

Slowly mix the hot milk-butter-oil mixture into the batter, stirring on low speed of a mixer until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth.

Divide the batter evenly between the two pans. You’ll use about 2 3/4 cups (about 580 g) in each.

Bake the cakes until the edges are pulling away from the sides of the pan, a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set. This should take 26 to ~{30%minutes} for two 9” pans, or 38 to 42 minutes for two 8” pans; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the cakes should read 205°F. Remove the cakes from the oven, carefully loosen the edges, and allow them to cool for ~{15%minutes} in the pans. Then turn them out of the pans and transfer them to a #cooling rack{}, right-side up, to cool to room temperature.

To make the frosting: In a #large mixing bowl{} or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together — by hand or mixer — the @cocoa powder{106%g}, 1 cup (113g) of the @confectioners’ sugar{454%g}, and the @salt{1/4%tsp}. Stir in the @hot water{74%g} and @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, scraping the bowl if necessary.

Add the @unsalted butter{284%g} and remaining confectioners’ sugar, stirring to combine. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the frosting at medium-high speed for 1 to ~{2%minutes}, until lightened in color and fluffy, stopping halfway through to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. When the frosting is ready, scoop out a bit on your #spatula{}; does it seem nicely spreadable? If it's too stiff, beat in water (1 teaspoon at a time) until it's the consistency you want.

To assemble the cake: Place one of the cake layers on a serving plate; tuck pieces of waxed or parchment paper underneath the edge of the cake to keep the plate clean. Spread the bottom layer with about 1 cup of frosting, enough to make a 1/4” to 1/2”-thick layer. Center the second layer bottom-side up (for a flat top) over the frosted layer and press gently to set it in place.

If your schedule permits, place the cake in the refrigerator or freezer, uncovered, for at least ~{30%minutes} (or up to 2 hours) to firm it up. This will make the layers less likely to slide around as you work, and the cake won’t shed crumbs as you frost. If you’re pressed for time, you can skip this step.

To finish the cake: For the best-looking cake, do the frosting in two steps. First, spread a very thin layer of frosting around the sides and across the top; this is called a crumb coat. You should be able to see the cake through the frosting in spots, it’s that thin. Refrigerate the cake for ~{20%minutes} to let this layer set. Again, skip this step if time is a factor.

Once the cake is chilled, use the remaining frosting to coat it thoroughly and evenly; our cake styling guide offers six pro-style options for ""styling"" your cake. If you have any leftover frosting, you can use it to pipe decorations on the top and/or around the base.

Store the cake, covered, at room temperature, or in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot. Let it come to room temperature before serving. For tips on slicing, see The best way to cut cake."

Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until you’re left with 1/2 cup (about 135g) or slightly more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25–35 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room temperature before adding to the cake batter. (See Notes for further make-ahead instructions.) Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.) Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop of pink gel food coloring.) Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24–25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack.

Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners’ sugar, strawberry powder, 1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting. First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!).

Storage information: Store cake, covered, at room temperature for several days. For longer storage, wrap airtight and freeze.

Note: There are a LOT of apples in this cake, by design. Some types of apples may not cook down as much as others, causing the batter to overflow a 9"" x 5"" pan. The filling has been updated to reduce the amount of apples from 4 to 3 1/2 cups, leaving the remaining ingredients the same. If you want a cake that's packed with apples, use the full 4 cups (452g) and put your pan on a parchment-lined baking sheet to catch any potential spills as the cake bakes.

Note: This cake can also be baked in a 9"" x 5"" loaf pan or a 9"" x 4"" x 4"" loaf pan; bake the cake for the full 65 to 75 minutes or a paring knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Be sure to place a baking sheet below the loaf pan as it bakes in case the apples don't cook down as much as expected and some juice overflows."

Note: If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, you can sub an equal volume of 1 part milk to sour cream or Greek yogurt. In a pinch, you can sub 1 cup of buttermilk for 1 cup of milk (ideally whole milk, but any kind will work) with 1 tablespoon of milk replaced with vinegar."
data/bronze/recipes/nicholaswilde_recipes/cook/desserts/cake/Victoria Sandwich Cake.source	Victoria Sandwich Cake		Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/350°F/Gas 4. Grease and line the cake tins with butter and baking paper. Weigh the eggs – 3 medium eggs in their shells weigh around 175g – then use this same weight for the butter, sugar and flour. Put the soft (but not oily) butter into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a food-mixer and beat well with a wooden spoon or the whisk attachment until very creamy and mayonnaise-like. Scrape down any butter mixture from the sides of the bowl with a plastic spatula, then gradually beat in the sugar a couple of tablespoons at a time. Scrape the mixture off the sides of the bowl again and beat well for 1 minute or until the mixture looks very light and fluffy. Scrape down the mixture again. Break the 3 eggs into a small jug, add the ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract and beat with a fork just until the eggs are broken up. Gradually add to the butter mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. If the mixture looks like it might be ‘splitting’ or curdling, rather than appearing smooth and creamy, stir in a tablespoon of the flour with each of the last two additions of egg. Sift the rest of the flour onto the mixture. Start to gently fold in the flour with a large metal spoon or plastic spatula and after two or three movements add the warm water. Keep folding in until the flour is well mixed in and there are no streaks.

Scrape the mixture off the sides of the bowl again and beat well for ~{1%minute} or until the mixture looks very light and fluffy. Scrape down the mixture again.

Break the 3 eggs into a small jug, add the 3/4 teaspoon @vanilla{3/4%tsp} extract and beat with a #fork{} just until the eggs are broken up. Gradually add to the butter mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. If the mixture looks like it might be 'splitting' or curdling, rather than appearing smooth and creamy, stir in a tablespoon of the flour with each of the last two additions of egg.

Sift the rest of the flour onto the mixture. Start to gently fold in the flour with a #large metal spoon or plastic spatula{} and after two or three movements add the @warm water{1%Tbsp}. Keep folding in until the flour is well mixed in and there are no streaks.

Grease a 9x13 inch cake pan* with nonstick spray or rub with butter. Make the streusel: In a large bowl, whisk together 3 cup flour, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 2 tablespoons cinnamon. Melt 1 cup butter in a small bowl in the microwave. Pour into the larger bowl and stir the butter into the flour. You should end up with a bowl of what looks like wet sand, with lots of big chunks. Don't try to smooth it out. See photo. For the cake: In a large bowl or stand mixer, whisk together 2 and 1/4 cups flour, 1 and 1/4 cups sugar, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Chop 3/4 cup softened butter into chunks. You want the butter to sit out of the fridge for several minutes to that it's not rock-hard, but don't let it soften so much that it's completely creamy. Add the chopped butter and 1/2 cup sour cream to the flour mixture. Use the paddle attachment (or electic beaters) to blend the butter in. Eventually the butter will moisten the flour and it will all come together in a ball. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Don't over mix, just beat until all the butter is incorporated. In another large bowl, whisk together 4 eggs, 1 cup sour cream, and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Beat well until the eggs are well blended. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture in 3 additions, beating for about 20 seconds after each one. Once all the egg mixture is added, beat for another 1 minute until the batter is light and fluffy. Spread 2 cups of batter into the bottom of your prepared cake pan. Sprinkle 1 cup of streusel evenly over the top, breaking up any too-large pieces with your hands. Spread another 2 cups batter on top and spread it around as best you can. Add another 1 cup streusel on top. Add the rest of the batter and spread evenly. Evenly spread another 2 cups of streusel on top of the cake. Do NOT add all the remaining streusel! There will be some left over. Spread the remaining streusel on a baking sheet to dry out a little bit. Bake the cake at 350 for 25 minutes. Do this next part fast. Remove the cake from the oven and shut the oven door. Use your hands to sprinkle all the remaining streusel on top of the cake, focusing on any areas where the cake batter has puffed up from the center. Move quickly! Get the cake back in the oven as soon as you can, and keep the oven door shut as much as possible. Bake for another 20-25 minutes.* The total bake time for the cake should be about 45-50 minutes, depending on your oven and whether you use a glass or metal pan. Test the cake with a toothpick. It is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with no wet batter on it. The cake should not wobble around at all when you shake the pan. Let the cake cool on a wire rack for at least 15-20 minutes for cutting into it. Make the icing: In a medium bowl, beat 1/4 cup butter until smooth. (I actually did it by hand with a whisk. You can do this if your butter is ultra soft.) Add 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup milk, and 2 cups powdered sugar. Beat with a mixer or by hand until very smooth. Drizzle the icing over the cake. You can either drizzle it over the whole cake or drizzle each individual serving. I like to drizzle about half the icing over the whole cake, and then save the rest of drizzling over each serving. The cake is best served warm!

Set aside. In a liquid measuring cup (or a small bowl) whisk together the sour cream and milk. Set aside. In the bowl of a electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl and an electric hand mixer), beat the butter on medium speed until creamy, ribbon-like and slightly lightened up; 2 to 3 minutes. With the mixer running on medium-low speed, gradually add in the sugar. Raise the speed to medium-high and continue beating together until lightened up in both color and texture; 4 to 5 minutes. The color should turn very pale (almost white) and texture should look fluffy. Add the eggs and egg yolk, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add in the vanilla and beat together for one minute. On lowest speed, add in one-third of the flour mixture and mix until mostly combined. Add in half of the sour cream/milk mixture and lightly stir until almost mixed in. Continue with adding another one-third of the flour mixture, followed by the remaining sour cream and ending with the last third of flour mixture. Mix until just combined and a smooth batter forms. Do not overmix. With a rubber spatula, give the batter one good, final stir to make sure that everything is well incorporated. Remove 1 1/2 cups of the batter from the bowl and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the milk, butter and sugar and heat in the microwave until the butter has melted. Whisk to dissolve the sugar. Add in the cocoa powder and stir really well until there are no lumps and a very thick chocolate paste forms. Add in the baking soda and stir again. Take a few tablespoons from the reserved vanilla cake batter and stir really well into the chocolate paste to lighten it up. Add the remaining reserved cake batter into the chocolate mixture and fold until evenly incorporated and no light streaks remain. (Note: The following method of marbling creates a cake with subtle marbleness, meaning that the vanilla and chocolate portions are more distinct in 2 different ends like a yin yang, instead of them being throughly mixed in a zebra-like pattern. It's just a matter of preference. Please see note below for a more layered marbling effect).

Once the mixture starts to thicken, add the remaining 1/2 cup @granulated sugar{3/4%cup} and continue beating. Once stiff peaks form add @vanilla{1%tsp} and beat to combine.

Gently stir in egg yolk mixture on low speed.

Add @all-purpose flour{1.5%cups} and @salt{1/4%tsp} and gently stir or fold in with a #spatula{}. The batter should be thick and pale yellow.

Pour about 1 cup of batter into the center of each square traced on the parchment paper. Evenly spread it out to fit the square, leaving about 1/4 inch border. The batter should be about 1/2 inch thick.

Sprinkle @confectioners' sugar{} on top of the ladyfinger batter to get a nice golden top.

Bake in preheated oven for 10 to ~{12%minutes}, until set and very lightly browned. Carefully transfer parchment paper to a #wire rack{} to cool.

Once cooled, carefully remove the lady finger squares from the parchment paper, set aside to use in the recipe.

Make the soaking liquid: Brew @coffee{1.75%cups}. Let cool. (or use instant coffee or instant espresso and brew 1 3/4 cups).

Whisk the @rum (optional){1/3%cup} into the coffee, then pour the mixture into a #large dish or baking pan{} that will fit the layers. Set aside.

Make the filling: In a #medium saucepan{}, whisk together @egg{6} yolks, @whole milk{1/2%cup} and @granulated sugar{1%cup} until combined.

Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture boils. Turn heat to medium low and boil for ~{1%minute}, remove from heat and transfer the mixture to a container with lid, but don't put the lid on yet. Leave the lid open and whisk the mixture every few minutes until it’s cooled slightly. Then put the lid on and chill in the refrigerator for ~{1%hour}.

NOTE: this can be done before you bake the lady fingers, if desired, so it has time to cool. It can even be done the day before and chilled overnight.

In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the wire whisk attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer), Beat the @heavy whipping cream{1.5%cups} and @confectioners' sugar{1/4%cup} until stiff peaks form, transfer to a different bowl.

In the same bowl used to beat whipping cream (but with the cream no longer in it), beat the @chilled custard mascarpone{16%oz} and @vanilla{2%tsp} with the paddle attachment until combined.

Gently fold in beaten whipping cream.

Add cooled custard mixture and beat until combined. Set aside.

Putting it together: Quickly dip one of the three lady finger layers into the soaking liquid for about 5 to 10 seconds. Do not drop it in and let it sit or it will soak up too much liquid and fall apart. Remember, homemade lady fingers are more delicate than store-bought. If using hard store-bought you will need to soak them longer.

Place it in the bottom of the baking dish you used to trace the shape.

Spread 1/3 of the filling mixture evenly on top of the layer.

Repeat with the second and third lady finger layers and remaining custard. Alternating soaked lady finger, custard, soaked lady finger, custard.

Sprinkle @unsweetened cocoa powder{1%Tbsp} over the top custard layer.

Chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight.

Cut into square portions and serve."

First, soak the chickpeas overnight (minimum of 8 hours, and you can go up to 24 hours). Make sure to cover them with enough water as they will expand 2-3 times their size. Drain the water (you can use this to water plants) and rinse well the soaked beans. Then, pat them dry as much as you can. Dry the chickpeas in a sunny warm spot or alternatively, dry them in the dehydrator or oven at 50ºC for 12 hours.Lay them out in single layers across baking sheets (or the dehydrator trays), for the quickest dry time. When the chickpeas are completely dry, grind them. If they're not completely dry then you'll end up with a 'paste' rather than flour- so be patient. You can blend them in a high-speed food processor/blender or grind them to a fine flour in a spice grinder. Sieve the flour to remove any lumps. Then, you can try grinding the larger particles again.

Cook at a medium boil, stirring often, for about 30-45 minutes, until the butter is nice and thick. Be careful, the mixture will sputter in the begining, Note: I use a splatter guard. You don't have to stir constantly, but keep an eye on it for scorching and stir often. I also like to use asilicone 'spoonula'because it makes it easy to scrape the sides and bottom of the pan. When it is ready, you will be able to drag a spoon across the bottom of the pan and leave a trail that will not fill in immediately. The butter will continue to thicken as it cools.

You want a heavy pot because that will help prevent the thick apple butter from scorching on the bottom of the pan as it cooks. Stir to combine everything and bring up to a boil.

Cook at a medium boil, stirring often, for about 30 to ~{45%minutes}, until the butter is nice and thick. Be careful, the mixture will sputter in the beginning, 

Note: I use a #splatter guard{}. You don't have to stir constantly, but keep an eye on it for scorching and stir often. I also like to use a silicone 'spoonula' because it makes it easy to scrape the sides and bottom of the pan.

When it is ready, you will be able to drag a spoon across the bottom of the pan and leave a trail that will not fill in immediately. The butter will continue to thicken as it cools.

For a silky apple butter, blend in a #blender{} until smooth.

Put the apple butter into a jar and refrigerate. It will last several weeks. To freeze, be sure to leave 1/2 inch headspace at the top of the jar to allow for expansion.

Note: If fresh @sweet apples (alternative){5.5%lbs} are to be used, slice apples into 1/4"" pieces and add to #slow cooker (alteernative){} with sugar and spices and cook for 10 hours on low. Puree with immersion blender until smooth. Add vanilla and cook for additional 2 hours uncovered, stirring occasionally.
    
Note: If you use unsweetened apple sauce and want to sweeten your butter, add @white or brown sugar, maple sugar, maple syrup, honey, or other sweetener (optional){} to taste. Add your sweetener along with the spices to the pan at the very beginning.

Note: There are many flavored apple sauces on the market, and you can use those, too."

If I have a lot of leaves, I arrange them in a single layer on a #baking sheet{}, then bake in a 350°F / 180°C oven for about 5 to ~{7%minutes}. Bake until dehydrated and crispy, but not browned.

If I have fewer leaves, or just don't feel like heating the oven, I'll throw them in a #large skillet{}. Single layer if possible, over medium-low heat. Again, you want to barely toast them, not brown the leaves much.

In either case, when you're done cooking. Remove from heat and let the leaves cool completely. They'll crisp up even more at this point. When cool, use your fingers to crumble the leaves completely, discarding any leaves that aren't crispy.

Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, yogurt, vegetable oil, melted butter and vinegar together until smooth. Pour the egg mixture into the flour and bring everything together to form a dough. Tip out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 10 minutes, until smooth, then divide it into six pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, then place the balls on a plate or baking tray, cover them with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the syrup. Place the sugar, honey and lemon slices in a pan with 200ml of water. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes to infuse. Remove the syrup from the heat, pour into a heatproof jug, stir in the rosewater and leave to cool. Lightly dust the work surface with cornflour. Roll out one of the balls of dough to a circle about 30cm diameter. Dust the top with cornflour, then fold the right-hand edge to the centre and the left-hand edge to the centre, so that they meet. Dust again with cornflour, then fold the top down to the centre and the bottom up to the centre, to give a rough square. Dust again with cornflour. Take each corner and fold them inwards so they meet in the middle to make a smaller square. Dust again with cornflour, then repeat Step 6, folding the corners into the middle again to give an even smaller square. Turn the dough over (joins underneath), cover it and leave it to rest for 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining five balls of dough until you have six small squares. Make the filling. Mix the walnuts, pistachios, sugar, cinnamon and cardamom together in a bowl. To assemble, roll out one of the squares of dough to a rough 30cm-diameter circle. Using the sandwich tin as a guide, cut a neat 30cm circle, and place this in the base of the tin. Lay any trimmings evenly on top. Repeat with a second square of dough, placing the pastry circle on top of the first circle and again laying any trimmings on top. Repeat once more with another square of dough and trimmings. Spoon the nut mixture evenly on top of the three layers. Repeat this layering process with the remaining squares of dough to make three more layers of filo, placing the trimmings from the top layer of filo on top of the fifth layer, so the top of the baklava is flat without any trimmings. Cut the baklava into a star design (as in the photograph), slicing all the way through the layers to the base. Pour the melted butter over the top, then leave the baklava to stand for 10 minutes while the pastry absorbs the butter. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 170°C/150°C fan/325°F/Gas 3. Bake the baklava for 1 hour, until the top is crisp and golden. Remove the baklava from the oven. Strain the cooled syrup through a sieve, then pour the syrup over the warm baklava. Leave it to soak in for 15 minutes before removing the baklava pieces from the tin. To decorate, sprinkle the ground pistachios over the baklava (in a pattern, if you wish), and finish with the rose petals	500 g all-purpose flour,2 tsp baking powder,0.25 tsp salt,2  eggs,170 g full-fat Greek yogurt,90 ml vegetable oil,50 g melted unsalted butter,1 Tbsp white wine vinegar,some  cornflour	"Sift the @all-purpose flour{500%g}, @baking powder{2%tsp}, and @salt{1/4%tsp} into a #mixing bowl{} and make a well in the center.

data/bronze/recipes/nicholaswilde_recipes/cook/ingredients/pastry-dough/Pâte Brisée.source	Pâte Brisée		In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt	450 g all-purpose flour,2 Tbsp granulated sugar,1 tsp salt,20 Tbsp unsalted butter,152 g ice water	"In a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{450%g}, @granulated sugar{2%Tbsp}, and @salt{1%tsp}.

Add the cold @unsalted butter{20%Tbsp} to the bowl with the dry ingredients and toss, separating the pieces and coating them in the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to quickly break and smash the pieces of butter into smaller bits (it’s OK if some of the butter is left in large pieces; you’ll break it up more in the next step). Make a well in the center of the bowl and add 2/3 cup (152g) of the @ice water{152%g}. Toss with a #fork{} to distribute the water until you have a clumpy mixture with lots of dry spots.

Tip the contents of the bowl out onto a clean work surface. Use a #bench knife or bowl scraper{} to chop up the mixture, breaking up the clumps and pieces of butter and periodically using the scraper to toss and push the mixture back into a pile. Continue to chop and toss the mixture until it’s broken down into small, uniform pieces with very few floury spots and the butter pieces are no larger than a pea. This process helps bring the dough together without working it excessively, increasing tenderness.

Push the mixture into a pile and squeeze it with your hands so it holds together in large pieces. If you still have some dry floury areas, move any large pieces to one side, leaving the dry bits in the pile. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of ice water over the floury area, then use the bench knife or bowl scraper in the same chopping motion to evenly distribute the water. Squeeze the dough to bring it together, move the large pieces to the side, then repeat with more ice water as needed until no dry flour remains on the surface.

Use your hands to pat the dough firmly into a square, then use a floured rolling pin to flatten the square until it’s 3/4 inch thick. Pat around the four sides with your hands or the scraper to square off and compact the dough then cut it in half.

Lift one half up (again, using the scraper to help) and place it directly on top of the other. Use the scraper to lift the stack of dough and dust underneath with more flour, then roll over it with the #rolling pin{} to flatten and lengthen it slightly, dusting the top with flour if needed to prevent sticking. Cut the dough in half again, this time crosswise, and stack the halves again. The stacking and flattening increases the flakiness of the dough and further distributes the moisture, making it easier to roll out.

Working quickly, use the scraper to loosen the dough from the surface and dust underneath and on top with more flour, then flatten it with the rolling pin into a long rectangle measuring 3/4"" thick.

If making the Walnut & Oat Slab Pie leave the rectangle whole. If making a round pie, cut the rectangle in half crosswise to make 2 equal portions. Whatever form the dough takes when it’s chilled is the form it will most easily assume when being rolled out, so if it’s destined to be round, as for a pie, use the heel of your hand to round off any corners and press the portion(s) into more of a disk shape. If it’s destined to be rectangular, pat around the sides to straighten and square off the corners.

Wrap each piece in your favorite #reusable wrapper{}, maintaining the round or rectangular shape. Roll over the wrapped pieces with the rolling pin to flatten the dough and force it to fill out the wrap (applying this pressure will help prevent cracking later).

Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and chill until it’s very cold and firm, at least ~{2%hours}. If a recipe requires a single portion of dough, freeze the other portion and save it for another use.

To roll out the chilled pastry dough: Remove the cold pastry dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or two to soften slightly. Unwrap the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface.

Use a rolling pin to beat the dough evenly across the surface, applying enough force to leave an imprint but not enough to crack or splinter it. If rolling it into a round, beat the dough diagonally in both directions to make an X, then roll lengthwise and widthwise. Lift and rotate the dough every couple of whacks to keep the round shape. If rolling it into a square or rectangle, beat the dough lengthwise across the entire surface, then rotate it 90° (a quarter turn) and beat crosswise, repeating several times in both directions. Continue to beat the dough, lifting it frequently and adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking, until it’s just under 1/2 inch thick. This will make the dough pliable and easier to roll out while still cold.

Dust underneath and on top of the dough with more flour, then roll it out, frequently lifting and rotating the dough to work it into a round, or turning it 90° every so often and rolling it lengthwise and crosswise for a square or rectangle. Continue to roll, keeping the dough moving on the work surface and dusting it with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have the size and/or thickness specified in the recipe. If it starts to feel soft or sticky, transfer the dough to a baking sheet and freeze until it’s cold and firm, about 10 minutes, then proceed."

Add the butter and pulse Add the egg and the water or milk (in small increments) and continue pulsing until a clumpy dough forms. To make the empanada dough by hand, follow the same instruction but use your hands to mix the ingredients together. Split the dough into 2 large ball, flatten slightly into the shape of disks. The dough can be used immediately or refrigerated until ready to use (1-2 days max). Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). You can also make small individual balls with the dough and roll out each individual ball to a round shape (doesn't need to be perfectly round) - if you have a tortilla press you can use it to flatten the dough balls. Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator/freezer to use later. To assemble the empanadas or turnovers, place a spoonful of the filling on the middle of each empanada disc. The amount of filling will vary based on the size of the empanada, but in general, it’s easier to seal an empanada that isn’t overstuffed. Also, the more you make empanadas, the easier it becomes to stuff them to the max and still seal them properly. To seal the empanadas, fold the disc and seal the edges by pressing the dough with your fingers. If you’re having a hard time sealing the edges, you can use brush the inside edges with egg white, it will act as a glue for the empanadas. You can also use a fork to help seal the edges, just press the top of the fork against the edges. To the repulgue or churito, the curl type seal, use your fingers to twist the curl the edges. There are also empanada molds that you can buy and will help seal the empanadas. For best results, I recommend refrigerating for at least 30 minutes the empanadas before baking – this also helps them seal better and prevents the filling from leaking out. If you want your empanadas to have a nice golden finish, then you can brush them with egg wash (a whole egg whisked or egg yolk plus a few drops of water whisked). Bake the empanadas in a pre-heated oven. I usually bake them at 375F-400F, the temperature will vary based on the oven and the size of the empanadas. I bake the smaller sized empanadas at 375F. The baking time also varies (again based on the oven and size), but it’s in the range of 18-25 minutes – the empanadas will be ready once they are golden	3 cups all-purpose flour,0.5 tsp salt,6 oz butter,1  egg,0.5 cup water or milk	"Mix the @all-purpose flour{3%cups} and @salt{1/2%tsp} in a #food processor{}.

data/bronze/recipes/nicholaswilde_recipes/cook/ingredients/butter/Almond Butter.source	Almond Butter		Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Spread the almonds across a large, rimmed baking sheet and toast the almonds for 10 minutes, stirring halfway. Let the almonds cool until they’re just warm (not hot), about 10 minutes. Transfer the almonds to a high-speed blender or food processor. Blend until creamy, pausing to scrape down the sides as necessary. You’re going to think it’ll never blend, but be patient! The almonds will go from flour-like clumps, to a ball against the side of the food processor (keep scraping down the sides and breaking up the ball), and finally, it will turn lusciously creamy. If the mixture gets crazy hot along the way, stop and let it cool for a few minutes. Once the almond butter is very smooth and creamy (no sooner!), you can blend in any add-ins you would like. I always add salt, for more flavor overall. You can also add cinnamon for a hint of spice, and vanilla and/or maple syrup for almond butter that tastes more special than store-bought. Blend until the add-ins are evenly dispersed. When I added maple syrup, I had to let the mixture cool, and then blend a few additional minutes, to make it creamy again. Let the almond butter cool to room temperature, then transfer the mixture to a mason jar and screw on the lid.

Cook until butter turns nut-brown and sage shrivels, then turn heat to a minimum. When the pasta is just about done, scoop out a cup of the cooking water. Drain the pasta. Immediately add it to the butter-sage mixture, and raise heat to medium. Add 3/4 cup of the water, and stir; the mixture will be loose and a little soupy. Cook for about 30 seconds, or until some of the water is absorbed and the pasta is perfectly done. Stir in cheese; the sauce will become creamy. Thin it with a little more water if necessary.

Dissolve the sugar into the egg whites: Bring a saucepan with a few inches of water to a simmer. Set the mixer bowl over the simmering water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Continuously, but gently, stir the mixture until the egg whites are very warm to the touch and the sugar has dissolved, about 4 minutes. Test this by dipping a finger into the mixture and rubbing it between your fingers—the mixture should no longer have any grains of sugar in it and should be very warm to the touch. Beat the meringue: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the meringue on medium-low speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually increase the speed and beat until you achieve a stiff peak that droops only slightly when you lift up the whisk, and the bottom and sides of the bowl no longer feel warm to the touch, about 4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and beat a few seconds to mix it in. Use your Swiss meringue: Swiss meringue is best when used immediately and served the same day. Do not refrigerated it in bulk or it will lose its lightness and become weepy. However, you can frost your cake or cupcakes and refrigerate overnight if needed; the meringue will be less airy the next day, but still fine. Did you love the recipe?

In a microwave safe bowl, microwave the milk and butter for 30 seconds until warm and the butter is mostly melted. The mixture should be warm, but not hot. If it is too hot, make sure to let it cool before adding to the yeast to prevent killing the yeast. Add the warm milk and butter to the flour mixture. Add the egg. Beat on low speed, gradually increasing to high until completely combined, about 2 minutes..Scrape down the bowl and add 1 more cup of flour, beating until combined. Add the remaining cup of flour in a little at a time until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and form a ball. Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and you can stretch a piece of dough out between your fingers without it breaking. This means the gluten has developed and your dough will be pillowy soft. Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and cover. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size. While the dough rises, make the filling. Combine the sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside. Once the dough has risen, roll it out into a long rectangle about 18 x 12 inches on a well floured surface. Spread the butter for the filling all the way to the edge of the dough. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the butter, pressing it down to stick to the butter. From the long end, roll the dough away from you into a tight roll, sealing the bottom edge down by pinching the dough together. Use floss or a very sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even rolls. Place the rolls in a 9 x 13 inch pan lined with parchment paper. Cover loosely with a dish cloth and allow to rise for another hour until doubled in size and puffed up. Bake the cinnamon rolls at 350°F for 30 minutes or until they are golden brown and no longer doughy. Allow to cool. While the rolls cool, make the cream cheese frosting.

Mix to combine.

In a #microwave safe bowl{}, microwave the @milk{1.5%cups} and @butter{6%Tbsp} for ~{30%seconds} until warm and the butter is mostly melted. The mixture should be warm, but not hot. If it is too hot, make sure to let it cool before adding to the yeast to prevent killing the yeast. Add the warm milk and butter to the flour mixture.

Add the @egg{1}.

Beat on low speed, gradually increasing to high until completely combined, about ~{2%minutes}.

Scrape down the bowl and add 1 more cup of flour, beating until combined. Add the remaining cup of flour in a little at a time until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and form a ball.

Turn the dough out onto a well floured surface and knead for about ~{10%minutes} until smooth and you can stretch a piece of dough out between your fingers without it breaking. This means the gluten has developed and your dough will be pillowy soft.

Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and cover. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.

While the dough rises, make the filling. Combine the @light brown sugar{2/3%cup}, @cinnamon{1%Tbsp}, and @salt{1%pinch} together in a #small bowl{} and mix well. Set aside.

Once the dough has risen, roll it out into a long rectangle about 18 x 12 inches on a well floured surface.

Spread the @butter{1/4%cup} for the filling all the way to the edge of the dough. Sprinkle the sugar mixture over the butter, pressing it down to stick to the butter.

From the long end, roll the dough away from you into a tight roll, sealing the bottom edge down by pinching the dough together.

Use #floss or a very sharp knife{} to cut the dough into 12 even rolls. Place the rolls in a #9 x 13 inch pan{} lined with #parchment paper{}. Cover loosely with a #dish cloth{} and allow to rise for another hour until doubled in size and puffed up.

Bake the cinnamon rolls at 350°F for ~{30%minutes} or until they are golden brown and no longer doughy. Allow to cool.

While the rolls cool, make the cream cheese frosting. In a stand mixer fit with the whisk attachment combine the @cream cheese{4%oz}, @butter{1/2%cup}, @confectioners' sugar{3%cups}, @milk{3%Tbsp}, @salt{1%pinch}, and @vanilla{1%tsp} extract.

You can also add one-quarter cup of flour to the recipe, which will produce a chewier doughnut with a less crispy exterior. Regardless, these doughnuts are best eaten very warm, as soon out of the pot as possible. The dough can be made by hand, using a large bowl with a wooden spoon, or in a mixer as directed. If you don’t have a donut cutter, you can use a 3-inch and 1-inch round cutter to cut out the dough. Like cookies, doughnuts rolled from scraps will be a little drier and less crisp than those cut from the first roll. Stir 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt together in bowl of stand mixer. Whisk buttermilk, butter, eggs, and yolk together in 2-cup liquid measuring cup. Fit stand mixer with paddle attachment, add wet ingredients to dry and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 30 seconds. Decrease speed to low, add remaining 2 ½ cups flour and mix until just combined, about 30 seconds. Stir batter once or twice with wooden spoon or rubber spatula to ensure that all liquid is incorporated. (The dough will be moist and tacky, a cross between cake batter and cookie dough.) Heat shortening in large Dutch oven over medium-low heat to 375 degrees. While oil is heating, line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly dust with flour. Turn dough onto well-floured work surface. Roll with heavily floured rolling pin to 1/2-inch thick. Stamp out dough rings with heavily floured doughnut cutter, reflouring between cuts. Transfer dough rounds and holes to prepared baking sheet. Gather scraps and gently press into disk; repeat rolling and stamping process until all dough is used. (Cut doughnuts can be covered with plastic wrap and stored at room temperature up to 2 hours.) Set wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line with triple layer of paper towels. Using your hands, carefully place dough rings into hot fat four or five at a time, depending on kettle size, adjusting burner as necessary to maintain oil temperature between 360 to 365 degrees. Using spider skimmer, turn doughnuts as they rise to surface. Fry doughnuts until golden brown, 50 to 60 seconds per side. Drain on prepared baking sheet. Return oil to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining doughnuts. For doughnut holes, transfer all to hot oil and stir gently and constantly until golden brown, about 2 minutes.

Cream the sugar and butter, then add the eggs. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sugar and butter. Beat on medium-high until light, fluffy, and doubled in volume, 2 to 3 minutes, using a rubber spatula to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce the mixer to low and add the eggs one at a time, adding the next egg only after the previous one is fully incorporated, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the wet ingredients. With the mixer still on low, add the the dry ingredients in three equal parts, alternating with the wet ingredients in two parts.

Take ½ cup of the blueberries and crush them with your hands so they are juicy; add to the batter and increase the mixer speed to high for 5 to 10 seconds to encourage the berries to release their juices even more. Immediately reduce the mixer to low and add the rest of the berries, mixing until incorporated evenly throughout the batter, another 30 seconds. Rest the batter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rest at room temperature for 1 hour. While the batter is resting, prep the oven and pan.While the batter is resting, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400℉ using the convect setting (if possible). Prepare two muffin tins by spraying the inside and border of every other cavity in the muffin tin generously with cooking spray. Portion the muffin batter into the muffin pan. Use a 1-Tablespoon or 3-Tablespoon cookie dough scoop to fill each sprayed cavity with 6 tablespoons of the batter. The first muffin tin will have six cavities filled, whereas the second muffin will will have three cavities filled. For the second muffin tin, you'll need to pour water into every other cavity to mimic the placement of the batter in the first muffin tin. Sprinkle the top of each cavity, aiming for the batter and avoiding the pan, with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar each. Bake the muffins. Bake each muffin tin for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the muffins are domed and golden brown around the edges. A skewer inserted into the center of a muffin should come out with a few crumbs attached.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and sour cream until completely smooth. Then mix in the vanilla, maple syrup, and oil followed by the butter and then buttermilk. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and gently whisk to combine. Stop right when the batter is fully combined – careful not to over mix. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. This will give the leaveners a head start, so each muffin bakes with a tall muffin top in the oven. If you’re in a rush, you can bake the batter right away. They just won’t be as domed on top. After 1 hour, preheat the oven to 425F and line a muffin (or cupcake) tin with 12 paper liners. Using an ice cream scoop, gently run the scoop through the bowl of batter. You’ll notice the batter is very fluffy, so be careful not to disrupt this as you scoop. Just run the scoop through the bowl and pull out the batter. Don’t mix it around or bother it too much. Over fill each liner just a smidge (see pictures in post for reference). You may have about 1 scoop of batter leftover which is to be expected. Top each muffin with a sprinkle of coarse sugar and a pile of mini chocolate chips. Really lay on those chocolate chips as they’ll disperse and spread as the muffins grow (see picture in post for reference). Bake at 425F for 8 minutes. Then, with the oven door still closed, reduce the oven temperature to 350F and bake for another 8-10 minutes. You do not need to wait for the temperature to reach 350F to continue baking, simply just adjust the temperature down to 350F and set a timer for 8-10 minutes. Quickly test a muffin with a toothpick to see if they’re ready, but try not to keep the oven door open for too long as you do not want the hot air to escape. Remove the muffins and let them cool for 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer each muffin to a cooling rack. The muffins may stick to the pan around the bottom edges, so just use a knife to pop them loose if needed. Let the muffins cool for another 10-15 minutes. They’re best served warm so enjoy!	320 g all-purpose flour,200 g granulated sugar,2.5 tsp baking powder,0.5 tsp baking soda,0.5 tsp salt,1.5 cups mini semi sweet chocolate chips,2 large eggs,65 g sour cream or full fat Greek yogurt,2 tsp vanilla,2 Tbsp maple syrup,2 Tbsp vegetable oil,113 g unsalted butter,255 g buttermilk,3 Tbsp coarse sugar	"In a #large mixing bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{320%g}, @granulated sugar{200%g}, @baking powder{2.5%tsp}, @baking soda{1/2%tsp}, @salt{1/2%tsp}, and 1 cup of @mini semi sweet chocolate chips{1.5%cups}.

In a separate #bowl{}, whisk together the @eggs{2%large} and @sour cream or full fat Greek yogurt{65%g} until completely smooth.

Then mix in the @vanilla{2%tsp}, @maple syrup{2%Tbsp}, and @vegetable oil{2%Tbsp} followed by the @unsalted butter{113%g} and then @buttermilk{255%g}.

Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and gently whisk to combine. Stop right when the batter is fully combined – careful not to over mix.

Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} and let it rest at room temperature for ~{1%hour}. This will give the leaveners a head start, so each muffin bakes with a tall muffin top in the oven. If you’re in a rush, you can bake the batter right away. They just won’t be as domed on top.

After 1 hour, preheat the oven to 425°F and line a #muffin (or cupcake) tin{} with 12 #paper liners{}.

Using an #ice cream scoop{}, gently run the scoop through the bowl of batter. You’ll notice the batter is very fluffy, so be careful not to disrupt this as you scoop. Just run the scoop through the bowl and pull out the batter. Don’t mix it around or bother it too much.

Over fill each liner just a smidge. You may have about 1 scoop of batter leftover which is to be expected.

Top each muffin with a sprinkle of @coarse sugar{3%Tbsp} and a pile of mini chocolate chips. Really lay on those chocolate chips as they’ll disperse and spread as the muffins grow.

Bake at 425°F for ~{8%minutes}. Then, with the oven door still closed, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and bake for another 8 to ~{10%minutes}. You do not need to wait for the temperature to reach 350°F to continue baking, simply just adjust the temperature down to 350°F and set a timer for 8 to 10 minutes.

Quickly test a muffin with a toothpick to see if they’re ready, but try not to keep the oven door open for too long as you do not want the hot air to escape.

Remove the muffins and let them cool for ~{10%minutes}. Then, carefully transfer each muffin to a #cooling rack{}. The muffins may stick to the pan around the bottom edges, so just use a knife to pop them loose if needed.

Let the muffins cool for another 10 to ~{15%minutes}. They’re best served warm so enjoy!"

Add the vanilla paste and bring slowly to a simmer. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar together until pale. Pour the mixture over the warm milk, whisking continuously, then pour into a clean, heavy-based pan and cook over a very low heat. Simmer the mixture gently for 3–4 minutes, stirring continuously, until smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, cover the surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming, then leave to cool. For the meringue. Heat the oven to 150°C/130°C fan/300°F/Gas 2. In a stand mixer, whisk the egg whites, salt, cream of tartar and 25g of the caster sugar on medium speed for 5 minutes. Increase the speed to high and add the remaining 50g sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking continuously to a soft glossy meringue. Whisk in the vanilla paste. Spoon the meringue into the piping bag and snip the bag 2cm from the pointed end. Pipe the meringue into the moulds and level with a palette knife. Place the mould on a rack set in a roasting tin. Carefully pour boiling water into the roasting tin to come just over the level of the rack. Do not let the water touch the silicon mould. Transfer to the oven and bake for 9–10 minutes, until set. Remove the mould from the oven and immediately turn out the meringues onto the silicone sheet. Leave to cool. For the caramel cage, turn the silicone mould upside down on a large sheet of greaseproof paper, so the domes are facing upwards. Lightly grease the domes with oil. Melt the sugar and glucose in a pan over a high heat and cook to a dark, golden caramel. Remove from the heat and plunge the base of the pan into a bowl of iced water to cool the caramel slightly. Using the back of a fork, flick the caramel backwards and forwards over the silicone domes to form 6 cages.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter and sugar until combined. Add lemon zest, and then cream the mixture until light and fluffy on medium-high speed, about 5 minutes.

The mixture may curdle a bit, but don’t worry too much about it. Add the flour mixture all at once and mix on low until almost completely combined. Remove the bowl from the mixer, scrape and fold any excess flour into the batter, and scoop out roughly 1/2 cup/100 grams of batter. Drop tablespoons of batter into the bottom of the prepared pan, and smooth into the bottom of the pan. (This batter will prevent the strawberries from sinking to the bottom of the pan and sticking.) Add the chopped strawberries to the remaining batter in the bowl and gently fold in until the strawberries are evenly distributed. The batter will be thick. Spoon the batter evenly into the pan, smooth the top and tap the pan firmly on the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles.

Season generously with salt and pepper. When the mixture begins to bubble around the edges of the pan (you don’t want it to come to a full boil), reduce the heat to low and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until it has thickened and tastes great to you, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Use a fork to remove the garlic halves from the beans. Set aside until cool enough to handle, then use the fork to remove the cloves from the skins.

Add onion wedges, water, tomatoes with their juices, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally and add additional salt as needed. Blend the soup, and then season to taste. The soup doesn’t need to be ultra-smooth; some texture is nice. An immersion blender does make quick work of this, or you can use a blender. When using a regular blender, work in smaller batches, and don’t fill it too high – hot soup expands! For safety, remove the lid’s center insert and cover the opening with a kitchen towel while blending. This releases steam and prevents messy splatters.

Zest the lemons into the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl. Remove the remaining peel and pith from 3 of the lemons by cutting off the top and bottom tip of each lemon. Stand each lemon up on one end, and use a sharp paring knife to follow the curve of the fruit and cut the peel and white pith away; discard it. Chop the lemon flesh into small pieces and remove the seeds and any large pieces of membrane. Transfer the chopped lemons to a bowl if the juice is running off of the board. (You should have about ⅓ cup.) Set aside. Add the granulated sugar to the bowl with the zest and rub the mixture together with your fingers to release the oils in the zest. Add the softened butter and oil to the mixture, and mix on medium speed with the paddle attachment or using an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally to ensure even mixing.

Stir the two yoghurts together with ½ a teaspoon of salt and pour into the cloth. Bring the edges together, form a tight bundle and tie firmly with a string. Hang the bundle over a bowl or from your tap over the kitchen sink. Leave the yoghurt to drain for 24-36 hours. After this time much of the liquid should have been lost and the yoghurt will turn thick and quite dry; the centre may still be creamy. Remove the labneh from the cloth and onto a serving dish or platter. Use the back of a spoon to spread it over the plate creating a loose wavy pattern, about 2 centimetres thick. Next, dice the olives or chop roughly. Place them in a bowl and add the oregano, parsley, lemon zest, garlic and olive oil, reserving 2 tablespoons of oil for the tomatoes. Use a pestle and mortar to crush the nuts unevenly, leaving some just broken and others finely crushed; add to the olive mix and stir. Spoon the olive mix over the labneh clearing about 2 centimetres away from the edge (you don’t need to use the whole quantity if you want your labneh a bit milder). Sprinkle with chilli. Finally, cut the tomatoes into thick wedges and mix with the onion. Arrange on a side plate next to the labneh, sprinkle with salt and drizzle with the reserved olive oil. Serve the labneh and tomatoes with torn out chunks of bread	450 g yogurt,450 g goat yogurt,0.5 tsp salt,20  black olives,1  garlic clove,1  lemon,1 tsp parsely,1 tsp oregano,100 ml olive oil,50 g pistachios,pinch  paprika	"Make labneh with @yogurt{450%g}, @goat yogurt{450%g}, and @salt{0.5%tsp}

For supermarket ones, the skin can be a bit thick so go ahead and peel them. Slice the cucumbers in half lengthways. If using regular cucumbers, also halve them widthways. Grab a teaspoon and use it to scrape out the seeds from the middle.  Put the cucumbers into a bowl and rub all over with a tsp of salt and set aside for 20 mins. The salt will season the cucumbers but also pull out some of the moisture.  Meanwhile, finely chop the preserved lemon and the coriander and add them to a small bowl along with the zest and juice of 1 lemon, a tbsp of the preserved lemon brine, 2 tbsp of olive oil and a pinch of salt.

some tips:
a good quality non stick pan will save you unnecessary stress of salmon sticking to a non-seasoned pan, and many tears of frustration
you can substitute the butter with 2 tablespoons of olive oil if your hesitant to use butter
add in a splash of white wine also for a gourmet feel! (i usually add in 3-4 tablespoons)
fresh parsley is the only way to go with this! i don't really recommend cooking or garnishing with dried parsley

Turn the dough out onto a work surface and divide it in half. (You can use a scale to get two equal halves if you wish.) Shape each half into a log about 9 inches long. Wrap the logs in parchment or plastic film and refrigerate for at least 3 hours. When you’re ready to bake: Preheat the oven to 325ºF. (See notes above re baking—if your oven runs hot, you may want to reduce the temperature. I preheat my oven to 300ºF, which registers 325º on an oven thermometer.)

Place the dough balls 6-inches (15 cm) apart  on to the prepared baking sheet. They spread to 3-inches (7 ½ cm) in diameter. You'll need to work in batches to fit your baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until golden brown. If they join together, use a sharp knife to separate while they are hot and soft on the baking sheet as they will harden very quickly. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes until they are no longer soft, then transfer to a cooling rack. Repeat with the remaining dough. In a microwave safe bowl, add the chocolate and microwave in 10 second increments, stirring in between until melted. Be careful not to burn.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/cookies-and-bars/Butter Cookies.source	Butter Cookies		Make room in your refrigerator for a baking sheet so the shaped cookies can chill for 20–30 minutes. Without chilling, the piped cookies will over-spread. If you chill the dough prior to shaping, the dough will be too cold/stiff to pipe. Line 2–3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats, or leave unlined. If unlined, do not grease the pan. In a large bowl, using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract, and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine. On low speed, beat in the flour and salt. Turn up to high speed and beat until completely combined. On medium speed, beat in 1.5 Tablespoons of milk. You want a dough that’s creamy and pipe-able (but still thick), so you may need up to 2–2.5 Tablespoons of milk. The more milk you add, the more the cookies will spread, so chilling in step 6 is imperative. I recommend keeping the amount of milk small and using a large enough piping tip, like the ones I suggest in the post above. Add your large piping tip to the piping bag. Spoon a little bit of dough into the piping bag and pipe a 1–2-inch swirl or line on the prepared baking sheet. The reason I suggest only a little bit of dough to start is because the dough may still be too thick to pipe. If it’s too thick, transfer that dough back to the mixing bowl and add another 1/2 Tablespoon of milk. If the dough is creamy enough to pipe, continue piping the dough in 1–2-inch swirls or lines, 3 inches apart on the baking sheet. See video for a visual if needed. If desired, place a maraschino cherry in the center of the swirl or sprinkle the dough with sprinkles and/or coarse sugar. Transfer the baking sheet to the refrigerator and chill the shaped cookies for 20–30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Bake the chilled cookies for 12–15 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The cookies will spread like all cookies do, but not completely lose their shape, especially if you chilled the shaped dough. If the cookies are smaller, they will take closer to 12 minutes. Keep your eye on them. They’re done when the edges lightly brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Tips from our Bakers: Flavor to taste: classic pizzelle are often flavored with anise extract or anise seed. Butter-rum, lemon, or rum flavors are also delicious. Simply add extract to the batter to taste. Start with 1/4 teaspoon; amounts will vary a lot, depending on the strength of the extract you choose.

One reader suggests the best way to grease your pizzelle iron is to dip a towel in vegetable oil, and wipe it all over the iron's interior plates. This helps avoid the sticky residue you may get from spraying the iron with non-stick spray."

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/cookies-and-bars/Lofthouse Cookies.source	Lofthouse Cookies		For the Frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine powdered sugar, salt, cream, and vanilla. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until creamy and soft, about 5 minutes. Using a spatula, scrape frosting into a small bowl, or as many bowls as you would like colors, and cover with plastic pressed directly against the surface. Set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature. For the Dough: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Using the same bowl and paddle attachment used for frosting (no need to clean), combine butter, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix at low speed to moisten, then increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy, pale ivory, and soft, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk egg whites, cream, and vanilla in a glass measuring cup until homogeneous. With the mixer still running, add liquid mixture in 4 or 5 additions, pausing to scrape bowl and beater about halfway through. Decrease mixer to low speed, sprinkle in cake flour, and continue mixing to form a soft dough. Fold batter once or twice with a flexible spatula to make sure it's well mixed from the bottom up. Using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, divide dough into 24 level portions and carefully drop onto 2 parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pans, leaving 2 ½ inches between each dough ball. If needed, pause to rinse scoop in hot water to ensure a clean release (misshapen scoops will spread into an irregular form). Bake until puffed and pale overall, but just barely golden around the very edges, about 15 minutes. Cool directly on sheet pans until no trace of warmth remains, about 15 minutes longer. To Finish: If you like, tint frosting with a drop or two of gel paste. Working with one at a time, dollop a shy tablespoon of frosting (3/8 ounce; 10g) over each cookie, spread into an even layer with a palette knife or butter knife, and top with sprinkles, if desired.

Using a #2 tablespoon cookie scoop{}, divide dough into 24 level portions and carefully drop onto 2 parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pans, leaving 2.5 inches between each dough ball. If needed, pause to rinse scoop in hot water to ensure a clean release (misshapen scoops will spread into an irregular form). Bake until puffed and pale overall, but just barely golden around the very edges, about ~{15%minutes}. Cool directly on sheet pans until no trace of warmth remains, about ~{15%minutes} longer.

If you like, tint frosting with a drop or two of gel paste. Working with one at a time, dollop a shy tablespoon of frosting (3/8 ounce; 10 g) over each cookie, spread into an even layer with a palette knife or butter knife, and top with sprinkles, if desired. Repeat with remaining cookies and enjoy immediately. Let remaining cookies stand at room temperature until frosting forms a crust, then transfer to an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between each layer.

Brown the Butter - Cut the butter into 14 even-sized pieces. In a medium skillet, melt 10 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until golden brown and a nutty aroma forms, 1 to 3 minutes.Remove the skillet from heat. Stir the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter into warm butter until completely melted. Mix the Butter and Sugars– In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the browned butter to the mixing bowl. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla. Whisk on medium speed (setting 5) until combined, 30 seconds. Whisk and Rest– Add the whole egg and yolk to the mixing bowl.

Pulse peanuts in food processor until finely chopped, about 8 pulses. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in bowl. Whisk butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, milk, and egg together in second bowl. Stir flour mixture into peanut butter mixture with rubber spatula until combined.

Place second cookie on top of filling, right side up, pressing gently until filling spreads to edges. Allow filling to set for 1 hour before serving. Assembled cookies can be stored in airtight container for up to 3 days. Since we knew that the starch granules in flour mute the flavor of peanut butter we briefly turned our attention to an Internet sensation flourless peanut butter cookies made with just peanut butter sugar egg and sometimes a bit of baking soda. Indeed when we tried a sample batch of our cookies sans flour they tasted super peanut-y and baked up looking much like traditional peanut butter cookies. Why didnt these flourless cookies melt right off of the cookie sheet Because peanut butter contains approximately  percent carbohydrates and  percent protein components that absorb moisture and harden into a stable network in the heat of the oven. But without the sturdier structure that only starch from wheat flour can provide these cookies fell apart in our hands before we could even take a bite.  Many recipes for peanut butter sandwich cookies disappoint with soft dull-tasting cookies and overly sweet fillings.

Cut 25g of the butter into cubes, add these to the bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the caster sugar, yeast and salt and stir to combine.  Beat the milk, warm water and egg together in a separate bowl and pour the wet mixture into the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon to bring the ingredients together, then turn out the mixture onto the work surface and knead it with a dough scraper for 5 minutes, until you have a slightly sticky dough. Wrap the dough and chill it for 1 hour.  Place the remaining block of chilled butter between 2 sheets of baking paper and flatten it out with a rolling pin to a rectangle measuring about 33 x 19cm.  Lightly flour the work surface and roll out the chilled dough to a rectangle about 1cm thick and measuring 50 x 20cm. With a short end of the dough closest to you, lay the butter on top of the dough, so that it covers the bottom two thirds. Make sure that it is positioned neatly and almost reaches the sides.  Fold the exposed dough at the top (without the butter) down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom third of the dough (with butter) up over the dough – you will now have a sandwich of 2 layers of butter and 3 layers of dough. Pinch together the edges of the dough lightly to seal in the butter and turn the dough/butter parcel 90 degrees, so the long seam is on the left-hand side. Wrap the dough and chill it for 20 minutes to harden the butter.  With the seam still on the left, roll out the dough on a lightly floured work surface to a rectangle, about 1cm thick and 50 x 20cm, as before. With a short end of the dough closest to you, fold the bottom one third of the dough up and then fold the top third down on top. Put the dough back in the fridge for 20 minutes.  <strong>Make the crème pâtissière.</strong> While the dough is in the fridge, in a medium bowl and using a balloon whisk, whisk the caster sugar with the egg yolks, cornflour and 1 tablespoon of the milk until pale and combined.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/breads/The Easiest Loaf of Bread You'll Ever Bake.source	The Easiest Loaf of Bread You'll Ever Bake		Weigh your flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess., Stir together all of the ingredients (except the cornmeal) in a large bowl, starting with 4 1/2 cups of the flour. Use a sturdy spoon, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough	540 g bread flour,1 Tbsp granulated sugar,2.25 tsp instant yeast,2.5 tsp salt,379 g lukewarm (90-110°F) water,some  vegetable oil or cooking spray,some  cornmeal	"Stir together 540 g to 600 g @bread flour{540%g}, @granulated sugar{1%Tbsp}, @instant yeast{2.25%tsp}, @salt{2.5%tsp}, and @lukewarm (90-110°F) water{379%g} in a #large bowl{}, starting with 540 g of the flour. Use a #sturdy spoon{}, or your stand mixer equipped with the beater paddle. Mix until everything comes together in a rough, shaggy mass of dough.

If you’re kneading the dough by hand, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, using some of the additional 1/2 cup of flour called for. Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you, then press it away from you with the heels of your hands. Rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this fold-press-rotate process with a rhythmic, rocking motion for about ~{6%minutes}. When fully kneaded, the dough will be bouncy and smooth.

If you’re using your stand mixer, switch to the dough hook and knead the dough at medium speed for about 7 minutes, until it’s smooth, elastic, and feels a bit bouncy. If the dough doesn’t form a ball that clears the sides of the bowl, sprinkle in just enough of the additional flour to make this happen.

Place the dough in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with @vegetable oil or cooking spray{}; the bowl you started with is fine. Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} or another airtight cover, and let the dough rise at room temperature until it's doubled in size, about 1 to ~{2%hours}. If your kitchen is particularly cold (below 65°F), place the bowl of dough in your turned-off oven with the oven light on.

Gently deflate the dough and cut it in half. Pat each half into a rough 6” x 8” oval.

Working with one piece of dough at a time, grab a short side and fold the dough like a business letter (one short side into the center, the other short side over it). Use the heel of your hand to press the open edge of the “letter” closed. Gently pat and roll the dough into a log about 10” long. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough.

Place the loaves, seam-side down, on a #baking sheet{} (lined with parchment if desired). Sprinkle the pan (or parchment) generously with @cornmeal{}; this will keep the bread from sticking and give it a crunchy bottom crust.

Let the loaves rise, lightly covered with greased plastic wrap, for ~{45%minutes}. They should become nicely puffy. Gently poke your index finger into the side of one of the loaves; if the indentation remains, your bread is ready to bake.

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450°F.

For extra-crusty crust and a great rise, add steam to your oven as follows: While the oven is preheating, place an empty #cast-iron frying pan{} on the lowest rack. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in the microwave or on the stovetop.

When your bread is risen, use a #sieve{} to dust the loaves with a thin coat of flour. Then make three or four 1/2” deep diagonal slashes in each loaf; these slashes will help the bread rise evenly as it bakes. Place the bread in the oven and pour the boiling water into the frying pan below. Quickly shut the oven door. Wear good oven mitts during this process to shield your hands and arms from the steam.

Bake the bread for 20 to ~{25%minutes}, until the crust is golden brown and a loaf sounds hollow to the touch when you tap it on the bottom. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 190°F on a digital thermometer.

Turn the oven off, crack the door open, and allow the bread to remain inside for an additional ~{5%minutes}; this helps keep the crust crisp. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack. It’s best not to cut into the bread until it’s cooled down a bit; cutting into hot bread can negatively affect its texture.

Store the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a couple of days. Freeze for longer storage."

To make the dough: Mix and knead @water{255%g}, starter, @instant yeast{1.5%tsp}, @all-purpose flour{420%g}, and @salt{2%tsp} together — by hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough. If you're using a stand mixer, knead for about 4 minutes on medium-low speed (speed 2 on a KitchenAid); the finished dough should stick a bit at the bottom of the bowl.

Place the dough in a lightly greased #medium-sized bowl{}, cover the bowl, and let the dough rest and rise for ~{45%minutes}. Gently deflate the dough and fold its edges into the center, then turn it over in the bowl before letting it rise for an additional 45 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Gently deflate it, and divide it into three equal pieces.

Round each piece of dough into a rough ball by pulling the edges into the center. Cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes; or for up to ~{1%hour}, if that works better with your schedule.

Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough slightly then fold it nearly (but not quite) in half, sealing the edges with the heel of your hand.

Turn the dough around 180° and repeat: fold, then flatten. Repeat this whole process again; the dough should have started to elongate itself.

With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 16"" log. Your goal is a 15"" baguette, so 16"" allows for the slight shrinkage you'll see once you're done rolling. Taper each end of the log slightly to create the baguette's typical ""pointy"" end.

Place the logs seam-side down onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet pan or pans; or into the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel (or couche). Cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaves to rise until they're slightly puffy (""marshmallow-y"" is the term we use in our baking school). The loaves should certainly look lighter and less dense than when you first shaped them, but won't be anywhere near doubled in bulk. This should take about 45 minutes to an hour at room temperature (about 68°F).

Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F with a #cast iron pan{} on the floor of the oven, or on the lowest rack. If you're using a baking stone, place it on a middle rack. Start to heat 1 1/2 cups water to boiling.

If your baguettes have risen in a #dish towel or couche{}, gently roll them (seam-side up) onto a transfer peel and then roll back over onto a piece of #parchment{}, seam-side down. If you don't have a transfer peel, roll the baguettes onto a piece of parchment (seam-side down) and then place the parchment on a baking sheet.

Using a baker's lame (a special curved blade) or a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three to five long lengthwise slashes in each baguette.

Load the baguettes into the oven. If you’re baking on a stone, use a baker’s peel to transfer the baguettes, parchment and all, onto the hot stone. Carefully pour the boiling water into the cast iron pan, and quickly shut the oven door. The billowing steam created by the boiling water will help the baguettes rise, and give them a lovely, shiny crust.

Bake the baguettes - on the pan, or on a stone - for 24 to ~{28%minutes}, or until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven and cool them on a rack. Or, for the very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about 2"", and allow the baguettes to cool completely in the oven, until both baguettes and oven are at room temperature.

Storage information: Store any leftover baguettes in a paper bag overnight; freeze for longer storage. Thaw and reheat just before serving."

The next day, drain the soaked chickpeas and place them in a saucepan, cover with fresh water, add a bay leaf and simmer for a couple of hours or until the chickpeas are soft.

In another saucepan, gently heat a smashed garlic clove, a sprig of rosemary (minus the twigs, or remove them before adding the chickpeas) and the chilli in a few tablespoons of olive oil. When the garlic begins to get fragrant and soften, perhaps even slightly colour, add the tomato and let sizzle for a few minutes. Add a ladle-full of the chickpea liquid (if you’ve used canned, use the liquid in the can) and about two-thirds of the chickpeas. Puree the remaining chickpeas before adding to the saucepan to create a creamy, thick sauce. There are some who remove the lump of smashed garlic before adding the chickpea puree – but I leave it in. Add more of the chickpea liquid (or water or stock) to the sauce until it is quite watery, then add the pasta and cook until the al dente and the sauce has reduced. If you choose to use a long pasta, you may want to cook it separately in a pot of water then simply add it to the ready sauce. By the time the pasta has cooked, the sauce should be creamy, not watery, but not too thick either. Like a creamy soup. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/italian/Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo.source	Olive Garden Fettuccine Alfredo		Cook the fettuccine according to package directions. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Stir in the cream, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, Romano cheese, egg yolks, salt, pepper and nutmeg. Editor's Tip: Be sure to choose a saucepan that will fit the sauce and the cooked fettuccine. Everything will be combined in the pan before serving. If you prefer a garlicky Alfredo sauce, feel free to add minced garlic or garlic powder in this step. Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F. Do not boil the sauce. Editor's Tip: An instant-read meat thermometer is useful for making Alfredo sauce with eggs. Monitoring the temperature is the best way to ensure the egg yolks won't get hot enough to scramble. Drain the fettuccine and add it to the saucepan with the Alfredo sauce and the remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. If you'd like, sprinkle parsley over the fettuccine Alfredo. Editor's Tip: After stirring the pasta, sauce and cheese, the thick sauce and cheese should cling to the pasta. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, let the pasta simmer in the sauce for a few minutes before serving	4 oz fettuccine,3 Tbsp butter,1 cup heavy whipping cream,0.25 cup Parmesan,0.25 cup Romano cheese,1  egg yolk,0.125 tsp salt,1 dash pepper,1 dash nutmeg,some  parsley (optional)	"To start, cook the @fettuccine{4%oz} according to the package instructions. While the pasta is cooking, you can prepare the Alfredo sauce.

In a #saucepan{}, melt @butter{3%Tbsp} over medium-low heat. Be sure to choose a saucepan that will fit all of your Alfredo sauce with the cooked fettuccine—everything will be combined in it.

Pour the cup of @heavy whipping cream{1%cup} into the pot, stirring to combine. While heavy whipping cream and heavy cream are typically used interchangeably for some cooks, they do contain a slight difference in milk fat content, so the consistency might be a bit different if you decide to substitute.

Once combined, sprinkle in 1/4 cup @Parmesan{1/4%cup} cheese, all the @Romano cheese{1/4%cup}, the lightly beaten @egg yolk{1}, @salt{1/8%tsp}, @pepper{1%dash} and @nutmeg{1%dash}. The extra dash of ground nutmeg elevates the flavor along with the usual salt and pepper combo, making the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce stand out among the rest.

Cook and stir the sauce over medium-low heat until a thermometer reads 160°F; do not bring to a boil.

Drain the cooked fettuccine pasta, then add it to the saucepan with the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce and the remaining Parmesan cheese. Stir together the pasta, sauce and cheese until fully combined. The thick sauce and extra cheese should cling to the pasta nicely. If the Olive Garden Alfredo sauce still feels slightly thin, you can let the pasta simmer for a few minutes to thicken it up before serving.

If desired, sprinkle with @parsley (optional){}. Serve with a slice of garlic bread or, even better, a batch of Copycat Olive Garden Breadsticks."

You can substitute part-skim ricotta for the whole-milk ricotta. Frozen whole-leaf spinach is easiest to squeeze dry, but frozen chopped spinach will work. Squeezing the spinach should remove ½ to ⅔ cup of liquid; you should have ⅔ cup of finely chopped spinach. Our tomato-butter sauce isn't strictly canonical; if you'd prefer a more traditional accompaniment, substitute our   Simple Tomato Sauce   or browned butter and fresh sage. Serve with a simple salad. FOR THE GNUDI: Line rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. Spread ricotta in even layer over towels; set aside and let sit for 10 minutes. Place flour, Parmesan, panko, salt, pepper, and lemon zest in large bowl and stir to combine. Process spinach in food processor until finely chopped, about 30 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer spinach to bowl with flour mixture. Grasp paper towels and fold ricotta in half; peel back towels. Rotate sheet 90 degrees and repeat folding and peeling 2 more times to consolidate ricotta into smaller mass. Using paper towels as sling, transfer ricotta to bowl with spinach mixture. Discard paper towels but do not wash sheet. Add egg whites to bowl and mix gently until well combined. Transfer heaping teaspoons of dough to now-empty sheet (you should have 45 to 50 portions). Using your dry hands, gently roll each portion into 1-inch ball. FOR THE SAUCE: Melt butter in small saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook, swirling saucepan occasionally, until butter is very foamy and garlic is pale golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Off heat, add tomatoes and vinegar; cover and set aside. Bring 1 quart water to boil in Dutch oven. Add 1½ teaspoons salt. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer all gnudi to water. Return water to gentle simmer. Cook, adjusting heat to maintain gentle simmer, for 5 minutes, starting timer once water has returned to simmer (to confirm doneness, cut 1 dumpling in half; center should be firm). While gnudi simmer, add salt and pepper to sauce and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are warmed through and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Divide sauce evenly among 4 bowls. Using spider skimmer or slotted spoon, remove gnudi from pot, drain well, and transfer to bowls with sauce. Garnish with basil and extra Parmesan.

Using a spoon, scoop potato flesh into a ricer or food mill fitted with the finest disk. Press potato flesh onto a clean work surface, spreading it into an even layer, and allow steam to escape for a few minutes. Drizzle egg yolks all over, if using. Scoop 1/2 cup flour into a fine-mesh sieve and tap to dust flour all over potatoes. Using a pastry blender or bench scraper, chop down repeatedly all over to cut flour and egg into potato. Using a bench scraper, gather up shaggy potato mass and pat into a loose ball. Press ball flat with hands, then fold in half using bench scraper and press down again. Scoop remaining 1/4 cup flour into sieve and dust all over potato dough. Continue to gently fold and press, just until a uniform dough comes together. (Make sure to simply fold and press down; avoid the smearing motion more commonly used when kneading bread.) Dust potato dough all over with flour and gently form into a log.

Scrape vanilla bean seeds into pan, then add pod. Heat over medium just until mixture starts to bubble around the edge of the pan, 7 to 8 minutes (do not let boil). Meanwhile, whisk egg yolks: In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks with remaining sugar and the salt. Temper eggs: Use ladle to pour a small amount of the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture, then whisk to combine. (This is called tempering and prevents the eggs from curdling.) Add two more ladles of cream mixture, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition. Gradually whisk in remaining cream mixture. Strain through a fine sieve into a large liquid measuring cup (to remove the vanilla pod and any cooked bits of egg). Bake: Divide custard evenly among baking dishes. Place pan in oven. Add enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the dishes. Bake until custards are just set (they should tremble slightly in center when shaken), 30 to 40 minutes.

Spoon butter mixture into a 12-inch flameproof skillet; cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is syrupy, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Working with 1 crêpe at a time, dip both sides of crêpe in sauce using 2 forks or silicone spatulas; fold into fourths with prettiest side facing outward. Lift and let excess sauce drip off; transfer folded crêpe to a baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining crêpes, scraping down sides of skillet as needed. Transfer folded crêpes back to skillet, overlapping slightly as needed to fit all 10 crêpes in skillet; scrape any excess sauce on baking sheet back into skillet. Sprinkle crêpes with remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Increase heat to medium. Add Grand Marnier and cognac; carefully ignite sauce using a long-handled lighter. Carefully spoon flaming sauce over crêpes using a long-handled, heatproof spoon until flames subside, about 30 seconds. Transfer crêpes to a platter; spoon any extra sauce over top.

Heat a #6-inch crêpe pan or nonstick skillet{} and rub with a little butter. Add 2 tablespoons of the batter and tilt the skillet to distribute the batter evenly, pouring any excess batter back into the bowl. Cook over moderately high heat until the edges of the crêpe curl up and start to brown, ~{45%seconds}. Flip the crêpe and cook for ~{10%seconds} longer, until a few brown spots appear on the bottom. Tap the crêpe out onto a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining batter to make 12 crêpes, buttering the skillet a few times as necessary.

In a #mini food processor{}, blend the 6 tablespoons of @butter{6%Tbsp} with 1/4 cup of the @sugar{6%Tbsp} and the @orange zest{1%Tbsp}. With the machine on, gradually add the @orange juice{0.33%cup} until incorporated.

Grease a large mixing bowl with butter or baking spray and pour in the cereal. Begin melting the butter in a medium-large saucepan set over low heat then stir in the marshmallows. Continue to melt over low heat, stirring often, until about 75	7 cups Rice Krispies Cereal,6 Tbsp unsalted butter,16 oz marshmallows	"Grease a #9 x 13 inch pan{} and a #large mixing bowl{} with butter or baking spray.

Pour the  @Rice Krispies Cereal{7%cups} into the greased bowl and set it aside.

Begin to melt @unsalted butter{6%Tbsp} over low heat in a #medium or large saucepan{}.

Add the @marshmallows{16%oz} to the saucepan and stir.

Continue to stir often, until about 75 percent of the marshmallows are melted.

Remove the pan from the heat and continue to stir, smashing the marshmallows using a #rubber spatula{} or the back of a wooden spoon, until the marshmallows completely melt and become smooth.

Note: We recommend taking the marshmallows off the heat before they are completely melted, so you will not overheat the marshmallows. The residual heat from the melted marshmallows will heat the unmelted marshmallows slowly, allowing them to melt without getting too hot. When marshmallows are overheated, the sugar crystallizes, turning into hard candy. Overheated marshmallows will make your treats hard to bite into.

Pour the marshmallows over the cereal and toss to combine.

Note: We recommend pouring the marshmallows over the cereal instead of adding them to the pan. If the cereal is poured into the hot pan, the crisp rice may become soft if it gets too hot. Your treats may taste stale immediately after they are made because the cereal will be soft.

Once the cereal is mixed with the melted marshmallows, pour it into a well-buttered 9 x 13 pan.

GENTLY spread it into an even layer. Do not compress the mixture or your treats will be dense and hard.

Allow the treats to cool for at least ~{30%minutes} before cutting into rectangles or squares.

Notes

European-style salted butter contains more butterfat than American-style butter adding richness to the treats. Salted butter balances out the sweetness.

We recommend using Kraft Jet-Puffed Marshmallows. They have great texture and flavor. We found store-brand marshmallows to be stickier. If you use store-brand marshmallows, we recommend adding up to one additional cup of Rice Krispies Cereal.

Store your treats in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

Do NOT refrigerate your treats. They will become stale-tasting if stored in the fridge.

You can freeze the treats. Wrap them well, and freeze for up to 3 months. To thaw, bring them to room temperature and let them sit, wrapped, for a few hours. Then unwrap and enjoy.

Do NOT overheat your marshmallows. This is key to making soft and chewy Rice Krispie Treats, not hard treats.

Do NOT compact the cereal treat mixture into your pan or you will end up with very dense, hard treats. Gently press the mixture into the pan."

Rub in the chilled butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add enough cold water to form a dough (about 6 tablespoons). On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a rectangle (approx. 15cm x 40cm).  Scatter half of the frozen butter over the bottom two-thirds of the dough. Fold down the top third and fold up the bottom third as if folding a letter. Turn the folded dough by 90 degrees and roll it out into a rectangle again. Repeat the process of adding the remaining frozen butter and fold as before.  Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes before using. For the crème pâtissière, pour the milk and cream into a pan. Add the vanilla paste and bring just to the boil, then take off the heat.  Whisk the egg yolks, caster sugar and cornflour together in a bowl. Pour the hot milk over the egg mixture whisking continuously.  Return the mixture to the pan and cook over a low heat, stirring continuously until the cream thickens. Cook over a low heat for 2 - 3 minutes to cook out the flour.   Remove from the heat and pass through a sieve into a bowl, then beat in the butter until smooth.  Pour out onto a shallow tray and cover the surface with cling film.  Leave to cool then chill in the fridge until set.   Heat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/425°F/Gas 7. Roll the pastry to a large rectangle measuring approx. 35cm x 45cm, about ½ cm thick. Place the pastry onto a baking sheet and chill for 10-15 minutes.  Place a baking sheet over the rolled-out pastry and bake for 20 - 30 minutes, until golden-brown and crisp. Remove from the oven, remove the top baking sheet and leave to cool.  For the icing, on a work surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, roll the white fondant into a 25 x 10 cm rectangle.  Break off small pieces of red and orange fondant and scatter them randomly over the white fondant.  Using a rolling pin roll the coloured fondant into the white fondant to create a smooth, patterned effect.  Cut out 4 rectangles of patterned fondant, each measuring 12cm x 5cm.  When the pastry has cooled, cut out 12 rectangles of pastry each measuring 12cm x 5cm.  Spoon the set crème pâtissière into a piping bag fitted with a ½ cm plain nozzle. To assemble, set aside 4 pastry rectangles. Place a raspberry in the corner of one of the pastry rectangles. Pipe a blob of crème pâtissière next to it. Sit a raspberry next to it and continue piping crème pâtissière with alternating raspberries until the pastry is covered. Repeat this process on the remaining 7 pastry rectangles.  Sit the rectangles on top of each other so you have 4 double-layered pastries, topped with raspberries and crème pâtissière.

Baking with milk chocolate chips is very convenient no chopping or little bits of chocolate to clean up or ahem eat but sometimes they wont act in the same way as a milk chocolate bar. Confusing we know. Our favorite milk chocolate chips while delicious contain stabilizers. That means that when they melt they turn gloppy and thick rather than creamy and smooth.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/desserts/Millefeuille.source	Millefeuille		To make the rough puff pastry, place the butter, salt and plain flour in a bowl and then gradually mix through the water, you may not need all of it. You want to have a soft, not sticky dough. Knead extremely lightly to bring together and then wrap in cling film and freeze for 5 minutes.  Meanwhile, line two baking trays with greaseproof. Once the dough has chilled, flour the surface and roll out the dough with sharp taps up and down the dough, rather than rolling, flouring the surface more if necessary. Continue to tap the dough up and down until it measures 30cm by 10cm.  Brush off any excess flour and fold the bottom third up and the top third down and turn so the dough looks like a closed book. Roll out again to the same size and repeat the fold before freezing again for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile, start making the crème diplomat by making a crème patisserie. Whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and flours until well combined and then heat the milk until just before simmering. Add 5 tbsp of milk to the egg mixture and whisk together to combine. Gradually add in the remaining milk and whisk until smooth. Place back in the pan and then bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly until thickened. Once thickened, remove from the heat and then transfer into a bowl and allow to cool completely.  Continue with the pastry and do two more rolls and folds, rolling and folding once more if the butter is still a little streaked. Rewrap in the clingfilm and allow to freeze for 10 more minutes. Preheat oven to 220°C/200°C fan/425°F/Gas 7. Once the pastry has chilled, divide in half and roll each piece out carefully to 26 x 26 cm and place on the lined baking trays. Top with another piece of greaseproof and top with two other baking trays.  Bake for 25 - 30 minutes or until golden and fully cooked through. Once cooked, remove the top baking tray and allow to cool on the tray.  For the jam, add the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice to a large saucepan. Breakdown slightly with a potato masher, then heat over low until the sugar has melted.  Bring to the boil, then boil for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to set.  Meanwhile, whisk the crème pat in a stand mixer until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk the double cream to soft peaks, then use a little of this whipped cream to slacken the crème pat. Fold through the remaining whipped cream. Transfer into a piping bag with a large round nozzle and then chill until required.  Once the pastry is cool, trim each square to 24 x 24cm. Divide each square into 8 rectangles that measure 12 x 6 cm. You should have 16 rectangles.   Sieve a quarter of your jam into a bowl, removing the seeds. Transfer the sieved jam to a piping bag and leave to one side until needed.  Combine the egg white powder and water to create a smooth paste. Break the block of fondant into small pieces and add to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle. Beat the fondant to break it down, then gradually add the egg white liquid. Continue to beat until you have a smooth, spreadable consistency.  Coat the top of 4 pastry rectangles with the fondant and smooth. Using the sieved jam, create a feathered pattern on each of the fondant topped rectangles.   Spread the remaining pastry rectangles with a small amount of jam, then pipe 3 long rows of crème diplomat blobs to cover.  To build the millefeuille, stack three crème diplomat topped rectangles on top of each other, then top with a feathered fondant rectangle.

Once the dough has chilled, flour the surface and roll out the dough with sharp taps up and down the dough, rather than rolling, flouring the surface more if necessary. Continue to tap the dough up and down until it measures 30 cm by 10 cm.

Brush off any excess flour and fold the bottom third up and the top third down and turn so the dough looks like a closed book. Roll out again to the same size and repeat the fold before freezing again for ~{10%minutes}.

Meanwhile, start making the crème diplomat by making a crème patisserie. Whisk together the @egg yolks{4}, @granulated sugar{110%g} and @all-purpose flour{50%g} and @cornflour{50%g} until well combined and then heat the milk until just before simmering. Add 5 tbsp of @whole milk{580%ml} to the egg mixture and whisk together to combine. Gradually add in the remaining milk and whisk until smooth. Place back in the pan and then bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly until thickened. Once thickened, remove from the heat and then transfer into a bowl and allow to cool completely.

Continue with the pastry and do two more rolls and folds, rolling and folding once more if the butter is still a little streaked. Rewrap in the #plastic wrap{} and allow to freeze for ~{10%minutes} more. Preheat oven to 220°C / 200°C fan / 425°F / Gas 7.

Once the pastry has chilled, divide in half and roll each piece out carefully to 26 x 26 cm and place on the lined baking trays. Top with another piece of parchment paper and top with two other baking trays.

Bake for 25 to ~{30%minutes} or until golden and fully cooked through. Once cooked, remove the top baking tray and allow to cool on the tray.

For the jam, add the @raspberries{400%g}, @jam sugar{400%g} and @lemon juice{1} to a #large saucepan{}. Breakdown slightly with a #potato masher{}, then heat over low until the sugar has melted.

Bring to the boil, then boil for ~{5%minutes}. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to set.

Meanwhile, whisk the crème pat in a stand mixer until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk the @heavy cream{300%ml} to soft peaks, then use a little of this whipped cream to slacken the crème pat. Fold through the remaining whipped cream. Transfer into a #piping bag{} with a large round nozzle and then chill until required.

Once the pastry is cool, trim each square to 24 x 24 cm. Divide each square into 8 rectangles that measure 12 x 6 cm. You should have 16 rectangles.

Sieve a quarter of your jam into a bowl, removing the seeds. Transfer the sieved jam to a piping bag and leave to one side until needed.

Combine the @egg white powder{4%tsp} and @water{4%Tbsp} to create a smooth paste. Break the block of @white fondant{400%g} into small pieces and add to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle.

Beat the fondant to break it down, then gradually add the egg white liquid. Continue to beat until you have a smooth, spreadable consistency.

Coat the top of 4 pastry rectangles with the fondant and smooth. Using the sieved jam, create a feathered pattern on each of the fondant topped rectangles.

Spread the remaining pastry rectangles with a small amount of jam, then pipe 3 long rows of crème diplomat blobs to cover.

To build the millefeuille, stack three crème diplomat topped rectangles on top of each other, then top with a feathered fondant rectangle.

Repeat with the remaining pastry rectangles until you have 4 millefeuille."

You can follow my recipe for an all butter flaky pie crust, use your favorite recipe, or a store-bought crust. To make the tart cherry pie filling: add frozen tart cherries, sugar, cornstarch, flour and almond extract to a large pot and place over medium heat. After 5 minutes or so, the cherries will thaw, begin to break down and the sugar will melt. Stir frequently during this time. Add in butter and amaretto and continue to stir. After another 5-10 or so minutes, the mixture will begin to thicken and start to bubble along the edges. Once the filling begins to stick slightly to the back of your spoon, remove it from the heat and set aside to cool off. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. While your oven preheats, make the dutch crumble topping: in a medium bowl, mix together the flour, brown sugar and oats.

While pulsing, add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, through the food chute, just until the mixture can be pressed together with your fingertips.  Form the dough into a disk and wrap it with plastic wrap.  Chill the dough for 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.  Unwrap the dough and roll it into a 12-inch circle on a lightly floured surface.  Fit the pie crust dough into a 9-inch pie pan and trim the edges so that only 1/2-inch extends over the edge.  Fold the edges under and crimp.  Freeze the pie crust for 15 minutes.  Line the pie crust with parchment paper and fill it completely with pie weights or dried beans.  Bake the pie crust until it is set and the edge is light brown, about 15 minutes.  Transfer the pie crust from the oven and remove the pie weights from the crust. Bake the pie crust again until it is golden-brown, about 15 minutes.  Allow the pie crust to cool completely on a wire rack, about 1 hour.  Combine the remaining granulated sugar and the water in a medium saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, and cook, without stirring, until the mixture is a deep amber color, about 9 minutes.  Transfer the mixture from the heat, protecting yourself from the steam, and gradually whisk in 1 cup of the heavy cream until it is smooth.  Whisk 1 tablespoon of the whiskey and 1/4 teaspoon of the salt into the heavy cream mixture.  Cool the mixture at room temperature for 30 minutes and then store it in the refrigerator until ready to use.  Whisk the egg yolks, the cornstarch, and 1/4 cup of the half-and-half in a medium bowl.  Stir the brown sugar, the remaining salt, and the remaining half-and-half in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Slowly whisk the hot brown sugar mixture into the egg yolk mixture and then return the mixture to the saucepan.  Cook the mixture over medium-high heat, whisking constantly and ensuring the mixture at the bottom of the saucepan is whisked, until the mixture comes to a boil.  Boil, whisking the mixture constantly, for 1 minute.  Transfer the saucepan from the heat and whisk in the remaining butter, the remaining whiskey, and the vanilla.

Lightly grease two 8” x 2” or 9” x 2” round cake pans; for extra protection against sticking, line the bottom of the pans with parchment rounds (you can cut these yourself or use precut 8” or 9” rounds), and grease the parchment. If your 8” pans aren’t at least 2” deep, use 9” pans.

Weigh your @all-purpose flour{240%g}; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.

In a #small bowl{}, combine the flour, @salt{1.25%tsp}, and @baking powder{2%tsp}. Set aside.

In a #large mixing bowl{}, either using an #electric hand mixer or stand mixer{} with whisk attachment, beat the @eggs{4%large}, @granulated sugar{2%cups}, @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, and @almond extract (optional){1/8%tsp}, until thickened and light gold in color, about ~{2%minutes} at medium-high speed. If your stand mixer doesn’t have a whisk attachment, beat for 5 minutes using the paddle attachment. The batter should fall in thick ribbons from the beaters, whisk, or paddle.

Add the dry ingredients to the mixture in the bowl and mix — by hand or on low speed of a mixer — just enough to combine. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl, then mix again briefly, to fully incorporate any residual flour or sticky bits.

In a saucepan set over medium heat or in the microwave, bring the @whole milk{1%cup} just to a simmer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the @unsalted butter{57%g} and @vegetable oil{1/3%cup}, stirring by hand until the butter has melted.

Slowly mix the hot milk-butter-oil mixture into the batter, stirring on low speed of a mixer until everything is well combined. Scrape the bowl and mix briefly, just until smooth.

Divide the batter evenly between the two pans. You’ll use about 2 3/4 cups (about 580 g) in each.

Bake the cakes until the edges are pulling away from the sides of the pan, a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the top feels set. This should take 26 to ~{30%minutes} for two 9” pans, or 38 to 42 minutes for two 8” pans; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the cakes should read 205°F. Remove the cakes from the oven, carefully loosen the edges, and allow them to cool for ~{15%minutes} in the pans. Then turn them out of the pans and transfer them to a #cooling rack{}, right-side up, to cool to room temperature.

To make the frosting: In a #large mixing bowl{} or the bowl of your stand mixer, stir together — by hand or mixer — the @cocoa powder{106%g}, 1 cup (113g) of the @confectioners’ sugar{454%g}, and the @salt{1/4%tsp}. Stir in the @hot water{74%g} and @vanilla{1%Tbsp}, scraping the bowl if necessary.

Add the @unsalted butter{284%g} and remaining confectioners’ sugar, stirring to combine. Using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer with paddle attachment, beat the frosting at medium-high speed for 1 to ~{2%minutes}, until lightened in color and fluffy, stopping halfway through to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. When the frosting is ready, scoop out a bit on your #spatula{}; does it seem nicely spreadable? If it's too stiff, beat in water (1 teaspoon at a time) until it's the consistency you want.

To assemble the cake: Place one of the cake layers on a serving plate; tuck pieces of waxed or parchment paper underneath the edge of the cake to keep the plate clean. Spread the bottom layer with about 1 cup of frosting, enough to make a 1/4” to 1/2”-thick layer. Center the second layer bottom-side up (for a flat top) over the frosted layer and press gently to set it in place.

If your schedule permits, place the cake in the refrigerator or freezer, uncovered, for at least ~{30%minutes} (or up to 2 hours) to firm it up. This will make the layers less likely to slide around as you work, and the cake won’t shed crumbs as you frost. If you’re pressed for time, you can skip this step.

To finish the cake: For the best-looking cake, do the frosting in two steps. First, spread a very thin layer of frosting around the sides and across the top; this is called a crumb coat. You should be able to see the cake through the frosting in spots, it’s that thin. Refrigerate the cake for ~{20%minutes} to let this layer set. Again, skip this step if time is a factor.

Once the cake is chilled, use the remaining frosting to coat it thoroughly and evenly; our cake styling guide offers six pro-style options for ""styling"" your cake. If you have any leftover frosting, you can use it to pipe decorations on the top and/or around the base.

Store the cake, covered, at room temperature, or in the refrigerator if your kitchen is hot. Let it come to room temperature before serving. For tips on slicing, see The best way to cut cake."

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/desserts/cake/Strawberry Cake.source	Strawberry Cake		Puree 1 pound of rinsed and hulled strawberries. You should have a little over 1 cup. Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until you’re left with 1/2 cup (about 135g) or slightly more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25–35 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room temperature before adding to the cake batter. (See Notes for further make-ahead instructions.) Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.) Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Beat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk *just* until combined. Do not overmix. Whisk in 1/2 cup of room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop of pink gel food coloring.) Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24–25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling. Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup crumbs. Set aside. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners’ sugar, strawberry powder, 1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting. First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides.

Let sit at room temperature until softened. Meanwhile, finely chop 1/2 cup roasted peanuts and 1/2 cups pecans until you have 1/2 cup of each. Place both in a small bowl and stir to combine. Make the peanut butter caramel sauce. Place 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a 2-quart saucepan. Heat over medium to high heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture comes to a rolling boil. Stop stirring and cook over high heat for 3 to 10 minutes, until the sugar develops brown streaks or is light brown in color. Swirl the pan by the handle and watch for the first sign of smoke. As soon as the caramel turns dark brown and smokes, take the pan off the heat, add 1/2 cup heavy cream, and whisk to combine. Be careful – the mixture will steam and bubble up violently. Return the pan to low heat and bring to a simmer. Add 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter and a  generous pinch of kosher salt. Whisk until the sauce is very smooth, then remove the pan from the heat. Beat the cream cheese with the whisk attachment on medium speed until very smooth and creamy, about 30 seconds. With the mixer running, very gradually add 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk, stopping to scrape down the bowl as needed, and beat until smooth. With the mixer still running, slowly pour in 2 3/4 cups cold heavy cream. Add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and beat on medium speed until soft peaks form, 5 to 10 minutes.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/desserts/cake/Victoria Sandwich Cake.source	Victoria Sandwich Cake		Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C fan/350°F/Gas 4. Grease and line the cake tins with butter and baking paper. Weigh the eggs – 3 medium eggs in their shells weigh around 175g – then use this same weight for the butter, sugar and flour. Put the soft (but not oily) butter into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a food-mixer and beat well with a wooden spoon or the whisk attachment until very creamy and mayonnaise-like. Scrape down any butter mixture from the sides of the bowl with a plastic spatula, then gradually beat in the sugar a couple of tablespoons at a time. Scrape the mixture off the sides of the bowl again and beat well for 1 minute or until the mixture looks very light and fluffy. Scrape down the mixture again. Break the 3 eggs into a small jug, add the ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract and beat with a fork just until the eggs are broken up. Gradually add to the butter mixture a tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl from time to time. If the mixture looks like it might be ‘splitting’ or curdling, rather than appearing smooth and creamy, stir in a tablespoon of the flour with each of the last two additions of egg. Sift the rest of the flour onto the mixture. Start to gently fold in the flour with a large metal spoon or plastic spatula and after two or three movements add the warm water. Keep folding in until the flour is well mixed in and there are no streaks. Divide the mixture between the two prepared tins - if you want to be really precise, use your scales, or just do it by eye, then spread it evenly. Bake for 20–25 minutes until the sponges are a light golden brown, and starting to shrink back from the sides of the tin. (Check the sponges after 15 minutes and if they aren't baking evenly rotate the trays.) Check that the sponge springs back when lightly pressed in the middle. When cooked, take them out of the oven and run a round-bladed knife around the inside of each tin to loosen the sponge. Leave for a minute to firm up, then carefully turn out the cakes onto a wire rack. Leave until they are completely cooled. If you are using cream, put a bowl and whisk (or whisk attachment) in the fridge to chill. To assemble the cake, set one sponge crust-side down on a serving plate. Using the back of a tablespoon, evenly spread the sponge with the 6 tablespoons of raspberry jam. Pour the cream, if using, into the chilled bowl and whip with the chilled whisk or attachment until it thickens and soft peaks form when you lift out the whisk. Spoon the cream onto the cake and then gently smooth it evenly over the jam.

Stir in the @sour cream{113%g}. The dough will be craggy but cohesive. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and bring it together, if necessary, with a few quick kneads.

Pat the dough into a rough square. Roll it into a rough 8"" x 10"" rectangle. Make sure the underside is sufficiently dusted with flour that you can move it around easily.

Starting with one of the shorter (8"") ends, fold the dough in thirds like a business letter. Flip it over (so the open flap is on the bottom), and turn it 90°. Roll the dough into an 8"" x 10"" rectangle again. Fold it in thirds again.

Wrap the dough in #plastic wrap{}, and place it in the refrigerator to chill for at least ~{30%minutes} (or overnight).

When you're ready to proceed, start preheating the oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a #baking sheet{}, or line it with parchment.

Divide the pastry in half. Roll one half into a 10"" square.

Using a 10"" round template (e.g., a dinner plate), cut a 10"" circle. Set the circle onto the prepared baking sheet.

To make the filling: Beat the @almond paste{170%g}, @unsalted butter{85%g}, @granulated sugar{99%g}, and @salt{1%tsp} until thoroughly combined.

Add the @egg yolks{2%large} and @vanilla{1%tsp}, and beat until well incorporated.

Mix in the @all-purpose flour{40%g} and @almond flour{48%g}.

Roll the other piece of pastry into an 11"" square. Cut an 11"" circle.

To assemble the galette: Spread the filling over the smaller circle, leaving a 1"" rim around the edge of the pastry.

To make the glaze: Mix the @egg yolk{1%large} and @cold water{1%tsp} together. Brush some glaze over the uncovered edge of the pastry.

Center the larger round of dough over the filled bottom crust, and smooth it over the filling. Using a #fork{}, press and crimp the edge of the galette to seal.

Brush an even coat of the glaze over the surface of the galette. (Doing this step before decorating the top will give your design nice definition and contrast.)

Decorate the galette by using the back of a knife to trace a pattern on the surface; you'll just barely cut into the surface without cutting all the way through to the filling. Poke a vent hole in the center, and four additional small slits at other random spots, hiding the slits in the pattern you've drawn. 

Bake for 30 to ~{35%minutes} or until it's golden. Don't be afraid to let it become deeply browned; this slight caramelization gives the butter in the crust wonderful flavor. Remove the galette from the oven, and cool it slightly right on the baking sheet.

For a shinier galette, brush the top of the baked pastry with a teaspoon or so of @syrup (optional){} (maple, agave, golden syrup, or your favorite) while it's still hot from the oven.

Serve galette warm or at room temperature. Store any leftovers at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage."

The outer leaves tend to be dark green and hearty, the inner leaves pale green and tender. I use them all. Rinse the leaves with cold water in a strainer, then shake off as much of the water as you can. At this point you want to dry the leaves as much as possible, so they toast (not steam) when you cook them. Gently pat them dry in a clean dish towel, or paper towels. Once dry you have two options for toasting the leaves. If I have a lot of leaves, I arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet, then bake in a 350F / 180C oven for about 5-7 minutes. Bake until dehydrated and crispy, but not browned. If I have fewer leaves, or just don't feel like heating the oven, I'll throw them in a large skillet. Single layer if possible, over medium-low heat. Again, you want to barely toast them, not brown the leaves much. In either case, when you're done cooking. Remove from heat and let the leaves cool completely. They'll crisp up even more at this point. When cool, use your fingers to crumble the leaves completely, discarding any leaves that aren't crispy.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/ingredients/pastry-dough/Filo.source	Filo		Make the filo pastry. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, yogurt, vegetable oil, melted butter and vinegar together until smooth. Pour the egg mixture into the flour and bring everything together to form a dough. Tip out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 10 minutes, until smooth, then divide it into six pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, then place the balls on a plate or baking tray, cover them with a clean tea towel and leave them to rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the syrup. Place the sugar, honey and lemon slices in a pan with 200ml of water. Bring to the boil over a medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes to infuse. Remove the syrup from the heat, pour into a heatproof jug, stir in the rosewater and leave to cool. Lightly dust the work surface with cornflour. Roll out one of the balls of dough to a circle about 30cm diameter. Dust the top with cornflour, then fold the right-hand edge to the centre and the left-hand edge to the centre, so that they meet. Dust again with cornflour, then fold the top down to the centre and the bottom up to the centre, to give a rough square. Dust again with cornflour. Take each corner and fold them inwards so they meet in the middle to make a smaller square. Dust again with cornflour, then repeat Step 6, folding the corners into the middle again to give an even smaller square. Turn the dough over (joins underneath), cover it and leave it to rest for 15 minutes. Repeat with the remaining five balls of dough until you have six small squares. Make the filling. Mix the walnuts, pistachios, sugar, cinnamon and cardamom together in a bowl. To assemble, roll out one of the squares of dough to a rough 30cm-diameter circle. Using the sandwich tin as a guide, cut a neat 30cm circle, and place this in the base of the tin. Lay any trimmings evenly on top. Repeat with a second square of dough, placing the pastry circle on top of the first circle and again laying any trimmings on top. Repeat once more with another square of dough and trimmings. Spoon the nut mixture evenly on top of the three layers. Repeat this layering process with the remaining squares of dough to make three more layers of filo, placing the trimmings from the top layer of filo on top of the fifth layer, so the top of the baklava is flat without any trimmings. Cut the baklava into a star design (as in the photograph), slicing all the way through the layers to the base. Pour the melted butter over the top, then leave the baklava to stand for 10 minutes while the pastry absorbs the butter. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 170°C/150°C fan/325°F/Gas 3.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/ingredients/pastry-dough/Pâte Brisée.source	Pâte Brisée		In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt	450 g all-purpose flour,2 Tbsp granulated sugar,1 tsp salt,20 Tbsp unsalted butter,152 g ice water	"In a #large bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{450%g}, @granulated sugar{2%Tbsp}, and @salt{1%tsp}.

Add the cold @unsalted butter{20%Tbsp} to the bowl with the dry ingredients and toss, separating the pieces and coating them in the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to quickly break and smash the pieces of butter into smaller bits (it’s OK if some of the butter is left in large pieces; you’ll break it up more in the next step). Make a well in the center of the bowl and add 2/3 cup (152g) of the @ice water{152%g}. Toss with a #fork{} to distribute the water until you have a clumpy mixture with lots of dry spots.

Tip the contents of the bowl out onto a clean work surface. Use a #bench knife or bowl scraper{} to chop up the mixture, breaking up the clumps and pieces of butter and periodically using the scraper to toss and push the mixture back into a pile. Continue to chop and toss the mixture until it’s broken down into small, uniform pieces with very few floury spots and the butter pieces are no larger than a pea. This process helps bring the dough together without working it excessively, increasing tenderness.

Push the mixture into a pile and squeeze it with your hands so it holds together in large pieces. If you still have some dry floury areas, move any large pieces to one side, leaving the dry bits in the pile. Drizzle 1/2 tablespoon of ice water over the floury area, then use the bench knife or bowl scraper in the same chopping motion to evenly distribute the water. Squeeze the dough to bring it together, move the large pieces to the side, then repeat with more ice water as needed until no dry flour remains on the surface.

Use your hands to pat the dough firmly into a square, then use a floured rolling pin to flatten the square until it’s 3/4 inch thick. Pat around the four sides with your hands or the scraper to square off and compact the dough then cut it in half.

Lift one half up (again, using the scraper to help) and place it directly on top of the other. Use the scraper to lift the stack of dough and dust underneath with more flour, then roll over it with the #rolling pin{} to flatten and lengthen it slightly, dusting the top with flour if needed to prevent sticking. Cut the dough in half again, this time crosswise, and stack the halves again. The stacking and flattening increases the flakiness of the dough and further distributes the moisture, making it easier to roll out.

Working quickly, use the scraper to loosen the dough from the surface and dust underneath and on top with more flour, then flatten it with the rolling pin into a long rectangle measuring 3/4"" thick.

If making the Walnut & Oat Slab Pie leave the rectangle whole. If making a round pie, cut the rectangle in half crosswise to make 2 equal portions. Whatever form the dough takes when it’s chilled is the form it will most easily assume when being rolled out, so if it’s destined to be round, as for a pie, use the heel of your hand to round off any corners and press the portion(s) into more of a disk shape. If it’s destined to be rectangular, pat around the sides to straighten and square off the corners.

Wrap each piece in your favorite #reusable wrapper{}, maintaining the round or rectangular shape. Roll over the wrapped pieces with the rolling pin to flatten the dough and force it to fill out the wrap (applying this pressure will help prevent cracking later).

Transfer the dough to the refrigerator and chill until it’s very cold and firm, at least ~{2%hours}. If a recipe requires a single portion of dough, freeze the other portion and save it for another use.

To roll out the chilled pastry dough: Remove the cold pastry dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or two to soften slightly. Unwrap the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface.

Use a rolling pin to beat the dough evenly across the surface, applying enough force to leave an imprint but not enough to crack or splinter it. If rolling it into a round, beat the dough diagonally in both directions to make an X, then roll lengthwise and widthwise. Lift and rotate the dough every couple of whacks to keep the round shape. If rolling it into a square or rectangle, beat the dough lengthwise across the entire surface, then rotate it 90° (a quarter turn) and beat crosswise, repeating several times in both directions. Continue to beat the dough, lifting it frequently and adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking, until it’s just under 1/2 inch thick. This will make the dough pliable and easier to roll out while still cold.

Dust underneath and on top of the dough with more flour, then roll it out, frequently lifting and rotating the dough to work it into a round, or turning it 90° every so often and rolling it lengthwise and crosswise for a square or rectangle. Continue to roll, keeping the dough moving on the work surface and dusting it with more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have the size and/or thickness specified in the recipe. If it starts to feel soft or sticky, transfer the dough to a baking sheet and freeze until it’s cold and firm, about 10 minutes, then proceed."

Add the butter and pulse Add the egg and the water or milk (in small increments) and continue pulsing until a clumpy dough forms. To make the empanada dough by hand, follow the same instruction but use your hands to mix the ingredients together. Split the dough into 2 large ball, flatten slightly into the shape of disks. The dough can be used immediately or refrigerated until ready to use (1-2 days max). Roll out the dough into a thin sheet and cut out round disc shapes for empanadas (use round molds or a small plate). You can also make small individual balls with the dough and roll out each individual ball to a round shape (doesn't need to be perfectly round) - if you have a tortilla press you can use it to flatten the dough balls. Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator/freezer to use later. To assemble the empanadas or turnovers, place a spoonful of the filling on the middle of each empanada disc. The amount of filling will vary based on the size of the empanada, but in general, it’s easier to seal an empanada that isn’t overstuffed. Also, the more you make empanadas, the easier it becomes to stuff them to the max and still seal them properly. To seal the empanadas, fold the disc and seal the edges by pressing the dough with your fingers. If you’re having a hard time sealing the edges, you can use brush the inside edges with egg white, it will act as a glue for the empanadas. You can also use a fork to help seal the edges, just press the top of the fork against the edges. To the repulgue or churito, the curl type seal, use your fingers to twist the curl the edges. There are also empanada molds that you can buy and will help seal the empanadas. For best results, I recommend refrigerating for at least 30 minutes the empanadas before baking – this also helps them seal better and prevents the filling from leaking out. If you want your empanadas to have a nice golden finish, then you can brush them with egg wash (a whole egg whisked or egg yolk plus a few drops of water whisked). Bake the empanadas in a pre-heated oven. I usually bake them at 375F-400F, the temperature will vary based on the oven and the size of the empanadas. I bake the smaller sized empanadas at 375F. The baking time also varies (again based on the oven and size), but it’s in the range of 18-25 minutes – the empanadas will be ready once they are golden	3 cups all-purpose flour,0.5 tsp salt,6 oz butter,1  egg,0.5 cup water or milk	"Mix the @all-purpose flour{3%cups} and @salt{1/2%tsp} in a #food processor{}.

Cook pasta until it is tender, but not quite done. Meanwhile, place butter in a skillet or saucepan large enough to hold the cooked pasta; turn heat to medium, and add sage. Cook until butter turns nut-brown and sage shrivels, then turn heat to a minimum. When the pasta is just about done, scoop out a cup of the cooking water. Drain the pasta. Immediately add it to the butter-sage mixture, and raise heat to medium. Add 3/4 cup of the water, and stir; the mixture will be loose and a little soupy. Cook for about 30 seconds, or until some of the water is absorbed and the pasta is perfectly done. Stir in cheese; the sauce will become creamy. Thin it with a little more water if necessary. Season liberally with pepper and salt to taste, and serve immediately, passing more cheese at the table if you like	2 Tbsp unsalted butter,30 leaves fresh sage	Place @unsalted butter{2%Tbsp} in a #skillet or saucepan{} large enough to hold the cooked pasta; turn heat to medium, and add @fresh sage{30%leaves}.

data/bronze/recipes/Diegothx_CookBook/ingredients/meringue/Swiss Meringue.source	Swiss Meringue		Combine the egg whites, sugar, and salt: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the egg whites, sugar, and salt. Dissolve the sugar into the egg whites: Bring a saucepan with a few inches of water to a simmer. Set the mixer bowl over the simmering water, making sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Continuously, but gently, stir the mixture until the egg whites are very warm to the touch and the sugar has dissolved, about 4 minutes. Test this by dipping a finger into the mixture and rubbing it between your fingers—the mixture should no longer have any grains of sugar in it and should be very warm to the touch. Beat the meringue: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the meringue on medium-low speed until foamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually increase the speed and beat until you achieve a stiff peak that droops only slightly when you lift up the whisk, and the bottom and sides of the bowl no longer feel warm to the touch, about 4 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and beat a few seconds to mix it in. Use your Swiss meringue: Swiss meringue is best when used immediately and served the same day. Do not refrigerated it in bulk or it will lose its lightness and become weepy. However, you can frost your cake or cupcakes and refrigerate overnight if needed; the meringue will be less airy the next day, but still fine. Did you love the recipe?

Turn food processor on low and add the cold water and malt syrup mixture. Mix for about 20 seconds, stop, and let it sit for 10 minutes. Once it has rested for 10 minutes, add salt. Turn the food processor on medium to high for about 90 seconds.. Remove dough from food processor and knead for about a minute. Next, divide dough into 3.5 ounce pieces. Roll the pieces into tight balls and cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes. Once they have rested, decide which method you will use to turn your balls of dough into bagels. For the best tutorial, watch the episode to see the difference in the methods. Option 1 - Twist Method: Roll out a piece of dough with a rolling pin until it’s roughly 5 inches across. Next, start from one end of the circle and start rolling the dough onto itself. Once it is rolled into a tight roll that is 9-10 inches long, it’s time to twist the dough. Place one hand on each side of the dough roll and then roll the ends in opposite directions to create the “twist”. Wrap the dough around your hand and then pinch the ends together. With the ring of dough still wrapped around your hand, roll the dough on your work surface to seal together. Option 2 - Punch Method: Take a ball of dough and place it on your work surface. Stick one finger into the center and shake the dough around your finger until a round hole forms. Pick up the dough and shape it with two fingers, coaxing it into a bagel shape. This method is easier, but doesn’t yield as great of a bagel texture as the twist method. Place the bagels on a baking sheet covered in cornmeal. Cover that with plastic wrap and let sit for an hour.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt. In a small liquid measuring cup, whisk together the milk and the vanilla. Cream the sugar and butter, then add the eggs. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the sugar and butter. Beat on medium-high until light, fluffy, and doubled in volume, 2 to 3 minutes, using a rubber spatula to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce the mixer to low and add the eggs one at a time, adding the next egg only after the previous one is fully incorporated, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl after each addition. Add the dry ingredients, alternating with the wet ingredients. With the mixer still on low, add the the dry ingredients in three equal parts, alternating with the wet ingredients in two parts. Beat until just combined, then scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl once more, then beat on low for an additional 30 seconds. Add the blueberries. Take ½ cup of the blueberries and crush them with your hands so they are juicy; add to the batter and increase the mixer speed to high for 5 to 10 seconds to encourage the berries to release their juices even more. Immediately reduce the mixer to low and add the rest of the berries, mixing until incorporated evenly throughout the batter, another 30 seconds. Rest the batter. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rest at room temperature for 1 hour. While the batter is resting, prep the oven and pan.While the batter is resting, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400℉ using the convect setting (if possible). Prepare two muffin tins by spraying the inside and border of every other cavity in the muffin tin generously with cooking spray. Portion the muffin batter into the muffin pan. Use a 1-Tablespoon or 3-Tablespoon cookie dough scoop to fill each sprayed cavity with 6 tablespoons of the batter. The first muffin tin will have six cavities filled, whereas the second muffin will will have three cavities filled. For the second muffin tin, you'll need to pour water into every other cavity to mimic the placement of the batter in the first muffin tin. Sprinkle the top of each cavity, aiming for the batter and avoiding the pan, with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar each. Bake the muffins. Bake each muffin tin for 18 to 22 minutes, or until the muffins are domed and golden brown around the edges. A skewer inserted into the center of a muffin should come out with a few crumbs attached. Cool the muffins. Cool the muffins in their muffin tin on a wire rack for 15 minutes, then use an offset spatula to run underneath the edges of the blueberry muffin tops to prevent them from sticking in the pan. Be careful to just run the offset spatula under the edges—you don't want to accidentally cut into the muffin bottom and decapitate the muffin from its top!After unsticking the muffin tops, keep cooling the muffins in the tins completely to room temperature. DO NOT TRY AND TURN THE MUFFINS OUT WHILE THEY ARE STILL WARM. Because these muffins are so top-heavy, you'll run the risk of accidentally pulling the tops and bottoms apart if the cake is still warm! Wait until they are cooled completely before turning them out of the pan. Run the offset spatula underneath each muffin top once more and gently tilt the muffin upwards to turn it out of the pan. Serve and store. Serve at room temperature. The muffins are best on the day that they're made, but can be individually wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days	2 cups all-purpose flour,0.5 cup almond meal or flour,2 tsp baking powder,0.5 tsp salt,0.5 cup whole milk,1 tsp vanilla,1 cup granulated sugar,0.5 cup unsalted butter,2 large eggs,2.5 cups blueberries	"In a #medium bowl{}, whisk together the @all-purpose flour{2%cups}, @almond meal or flour{1/2%cup}, @baking powder{2%tsp}, and @salt{1/2%tsp}. In a #small liquid measuring cup{}, whisk together the @whole milk{1/2%cup} and the @vanilla{1%tsp}.

In the bowl of a #stand mixer{} fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the @granulated sugar{1%cup} and @unsalted butter{1/2%cup}. Beat on medium-high until light, fluffy, and doubled in volume, 2 to ~{3%minutes}, using a #rubber spatula{} to scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl as necessary. Reduce the mixer to low and add the @eggs{2%large} one at a time, adding the next egg only after the previous one is fully incorporated, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl after each addition.

With the mixer still on low, add the dry ingredients in three equal parts, alternating with the wet ingredients in two parts. Beat until just combined, then scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl once more, then beat on low for an additional 30 seconds. Take 1/2 cup of the @blueberries{2.5%cups} and crush them with your hands so they are juicy; add to the batter and increase the mixer speed to high for 5 to 10 seconds to encourage the berries to release their juices even more. Immediately reduce the mixer to low and add the rest of the berries, mixing until incorporated evenly throughout the batter, another 30 seconds.

Cover the bowl with #plastic wrap{} and let the batter rest at room temperature for ~{1%hour}.

While the batter is resting, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400°F using the convection setting (if possible). Prepare two muffin tins by spraying the inside and border of every other cavity in the muffin tin generously with cooking spray.

Use a 1 tablespoon or 3 tablespoon cookie dough scoop to fill each sprayed cavity with 6 tablespoons of the batter. The first muffin tin will have six cavities filled, whereas the second muffin will have three cavities filled. For the second muffin tin, you'll need to pour water into every other cavity to mimic the placement of the batter in the first muffin tin. Sprinkle the top of each cavity, aiming for the batter and avoiding the pan, with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar each.

Bake each muffin tin for 18 to ~{22%minutes}, or until the muffins are domed and golden brown around the edges. A skewer inserted into the center of a muffin should come out with a few crumbs attached. Cool the muffins in their muffin tin on a wire rack for ~{15%minutes}, then use an #offset spatula{} to run underneath the edges of the blueberry muffin tops to prevent them from sticking in the pan. Be careful to just run the offset spatula under the edges—you don't want to accidentally cut into the muffin bottom and decapitate the muffin from its top!

After unsticking the muffin tops, keep cooling the muffins in the tins completely to room temperature. DO NOT TRY AND TURN THE MUFFINS OUT WHILE THEY ARE STILL WARM. Because these muffins are so top-heavy, you’ll run the risk of accidentally pulling the tops and bottoms apart if the cake is still warm! Wait until they are cooled completely before turning them out of the pan. Run the offset spatula underneath each muffin top once more and gently tilt the muffin upwards to turn it out of the pan. The muffins are best on the day that they’re made, but can be individually wrapped in plastic and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days."

data/bronze/recipes/ignacio-gn_cook/main/pork/kakuni.source	kakuni		Gather all the ingredients. I made quick dashi using a dashi packet (it only takes 3 minutes). Leave the eggs in the refrigerator until ready to use. Cut 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) in half to separate the green and white parts. Cut the green part into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. Set aside the white part to make Shiraga Negi later for garnish (see how in To Serve below). Cut 1 knob ginger (unpeeled) into thin slices. Divide; set aside half for slow-cooking the pork and the other half for braising. Cut 1⅔ lb pork belly strips into shorter blocks that will lie straight when placed in a large pot later (I use a 4 QT Staub). If your pork belly is already in smaller blocks, you don't need to cut it. To sear, heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When it‘s hot, add ½ Tbsp neutral oil. Tip: Using the oil helps render the pork's fat faster. Place the pork belly fat side down in the hot skillet. (Do not overcrowd the pot. Sear in batches if you're doubling the recipe.) To prevent oil splatter, you can use a splatter screen. Tip: Searing the surface of the meat before boiling helps draw out excess fat and lock in the flavor. Sear the meat until all sides are nicely browned, about 2–3 minutes per side. Transfer the seared pork belly pieces to the large, heavy-bottomed pot. Lay them straight and in a single layer. To the pot, add ¼ cup sake and enough water to cover the meat. To start off, I added 1.5 QT or 1.5 L water for a single batch of the recipe; however, if there's enough room in your pot, add 2 QT or 2 L of water. Add the green part of the negi and half of the sliced ginger (save the other half for braising later). Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Tip: Boiling the meat removes the excess fat and scum while keeping the meat juicy. Skim the scum and fat with a fine-mesh skimmer, and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Place an otoshibuta (drop lid) directly on top of the pork belly. You can buy an otoshibuta on Amazon or make one with aluminum foil following my post on How To Make Otoshibuta. Cook, uncovered, on a *gentle simmer*, for 3 hours. Leave off the pot lid so the unwanted odor goes away. Tip: I cannot emphasize enough that slow, gentle cooking is the key. If you cook on strong heat, the meat will become tough. When the liquid is running low, add more water or hot water (I added another 0.5 QT or 0.5 L) to the pot so the meat remains submerged at all times. Tip: Make sure the meat is not exposed, or else it will become dry. Meanwhile, boil enough water in a medium saucepan so the eggs will be completely submerged when added. Remove 4 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) from the refrigerator. Gently lower the cold eggs into the boiling water using a fine-mesh skimmer. Set a timer for 6½–7 minutes and soft-boil them on medium-low heat. As soon as the timer is up, transfer the eggs to a bowl of iced water to stop the cooking. Let them cool, peel them, and set aside. Bring a small amount of water in the same pot to a boil. Remove the tough strings from 5 snap peas and add them to the boiling water. Blanch them until tender, about 1½–2 minutes. Set aside until ready to serve. After cooking for 3 hours, remove the otoshibuta (drop lid) and check the meat for tenderness. Tip: For really tender pork belly, cook for at least 3 hours and add more water as needed to keep the meat fully submerged. Remove the pork belly to a tray or plate. If you'd like, you can strain and reserve the cooking liquid as a stock for other recipes. Let the liquid sit in the fridge and skim off any fat that floats to the top before using. Gently cut the pork belly into 2-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. The pork should be very tender by now, so handle carefully. Place the pieces in a single layer in a medium, heavy-bottomed pot (I use a 2.75 QT Staub). Tip: Use a medium pot for a tighter fit so the seasonings will completely cover the meat. If you use the same large pot as before, you may need to increase the amount of seasonings to cover the meat. Cut 1 dried red chili pepper (optional) in half and discard the seeds. If you like it spicy, you can include the seeds. Add 2½ cups dashi (Japanese soup stock), ¼ cup sake, ¼ cup mirin, ¼ cup sugar, and the dried red chili pepper. Add the rest of the ginger slices and place the otoshibuta (drop lid) on top. Do not cover with the pot's lid. Start cooking on medium heat. Once simmering, reduce the heat to low or medium low and cook, uncovered, on a gentle simmer. Set a timer for 1 hour. At the halfway point (30 minutes), add ¼ cup soy sauce. Tip: We add the soy sauce later on to keep the meat from cooking in it a long time and becoming salty. Add the peeled soft-boiled eggs to the pot. Place the otoshibuta (drop lid) on the meat and continue simmering, uncovered, for the remaining 30 minutes. If the cooking liquid gets low, reduce the heat to low (your stove's lowest setting). Occasionally, shake the pot to coat the meat and eggs with the braising liquid. Make sure there‘s enough liquid in the pot so the pork and eggs don‘t burn. It should be plenty of liquid; if your liquid is low, you might have been cooking on higher heat. After braising for 1 hour, turn off the heat. It's now ready to serve. Use the white part of 1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) to make shiraga negi. First, cut the white part into pieces that are 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Then, make a lengthwise incision to remove the soft green core (save it for another use). Stack the outer layers, holding them flat against the cutting board, and slice lengthwise into very thin julienned strips. Soak in a bowl of iced water for 5–10 minutes to remove the bitterness, and drain well. Tip: For step-by-step photos, see my tutorial on How To Make Shiraga Negi. Serve the Kakuni, eggs, and snap peas in individual bowls. Drizzle with some braising liquid and garnish on top with shiraga negi. Season with optional shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) for a spicy kick. For a more flavorful Kakuni, wait several hours before serving. Kakuni tastes best when gradually cooled in the braising liquid, allowing the food to absorb more flavors. Gently reheat thoroughly and serve. If you prefer a less oily Kakuni, serve it the next day. Let it cool completely, then refrigerate the pork belly in its braising liquid overnight. The next day, remove and discard the solidified fat. Gently reheat the Kakuni thoroughly and serve. You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days and in the freezer for a month	450 g pork belly,some  oil,1 knob ginger,2  green onions,some  water,3  eggs,some  dashi,some  sake,some  mirin,some  sugar,some  soy sauce,some  red chili pepper	"Pound the @pork belly{450%g} on both sides to tenderize it
