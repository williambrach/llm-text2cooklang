Ingredients: 3 eggs,125 g flour,250 ml milk,1 pinch sea salt,some oil
Recipe Text: Crack the eggs into a blender, then add the flour, milk and sea salt, and blitz until smooth. Pour into a bowl and leave to stand for 15 minutes. Melt the butter (or a drizzle of oil if you want to be a bit healthier) in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, then tilt the pan so the butter coats the surface. Pour in 1 ladle of batter and tilt again, so that the batter spreads all over the base, then cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it starts to come away from the sides. Once golden underneath, flip the pancake over and cook for 1 further minute, or until cooked through. Serve straightaway with your favourite topping.
