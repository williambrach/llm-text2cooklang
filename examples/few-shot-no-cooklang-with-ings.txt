Ingredients: 400 g water,60 g potatoes,30 g carrots,40 g salmon fillet,40 g hake fillet,30 g soy sauce,20 g fish sauce,20 g cherry tomatoes,5 g green peppers,50 g double cream

Recipe Text: Pour 400g of water into a saucepan and put on a medium heat. Peel and cut the potatoes (60g) into large pieces (if the potatoes are small with thin skin, you can simply rinse them and cut them in half without peeling), peel the carrots (30g) and cut them into smaller chunks. Place the vegetables into the pan and boil covered with a lid on until soft. Next, cut the salmon fillet (40g) and hake fillet (40g) into large pieces and add to the vegetables, add soy sauce (30g) and fish sauce (20g), halved cherry tomatoes (20g), chopped green peppers (5g) and double cream (50g). It is not necessary to cook for a long time, so as not to overcook the fish, it is enough to bring the soup gently to a boil.
